		Captain Amber Paisley<br/>
		Explorer Fleet Starship Definitive</p> <br/> <p class="mb-4">While observing the planet Apex Nine in the Outer Straus System, a mysterious cloud of organic
		matter, comprised mostly of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, appeared near the ship. It
		moved like ocean waves. Quickly the cloud surrounded the ship and seeped inside.</p> <p class="mb-4">I put all decks on high alert. Kalal Trainer, Chief of Bioengineering, confirmed that the cloud
		matter was everywhere inside the ship. He listed everywhere it was, in the air, the water, the
		food, and our clothes, right now, right here it was on our skin. There was no doubt that it was
		inside all of us. Trainer told me he was almost positive that there was no threat. He would run
		more tests to see what else may lay in their elemental makeup.</p> <p class="mb-4">I lowered the ship-wide alert to yellow. I trusted Chief Trainer, but I needed the Doctor
		involved as well.</p> <p class="mb-4">The Doctor, Tom Orlando, had already heard everything about the cloud but was more concerned
		with the recovery of nine of his patients quarantined with Blargius Muscle Flu from a prior
		mission to Nelves Titan. Those infected with Blargius Muscle Flu had a one in four chance of
		death and symptoms that kept the patient bedridden until they passed on or recovered with
		lifelong tissue scarring. The real problem was that those affected with the flu were fully
		recovered and showed no signs of ever being infected by the virus.</p> <p class="mb-4">I liked to think that having my nine crewmembers back to work wasn&#39;t a problem, but the Doctor
		didn&#39;t see it the same way. I reminded him that since the flu was no longer a threat to their
		health, he could get to work on the cloud substance&#39;s affects without disruption. I chose to
		ignore his mumblings about “real” priorities.</p> <p class="mb-4">While I was content in waiting for Trainer and Orlando&#39;s conclusions, my First Officer, Sam
		Castle, expressed his distaste for me not taking the organic matter more seriously. Castle
		reminded me that the organic matter was inside our bodies. Castle&#39;s concerns were exacerbated
		due to a phobia of “body snatchers.” After what happened to him on Shalous, I don&#39;t blame him.</p> <p class="mb-4">It was at this point that I thought I heard a tinny, small voice on the bridge. It was hard to
		tell what language it was, but I&#39;m sure some of it was English. Something</p> <br/> <br/> <p class="mb-4">about final destruction of them. Castle heard a different voice; he described his as being deep
		and slow.</p> <p class="mb-4">The Doctor came on the view screen. Before he could get a word out I asked if he had heard any
		voices. He recommended me for a brain scan and psychotics medication. Behind Dr. Orlando there
		was an Ensign Jaino doing jumping jacks, running in place, and doing cartwheels. After reminding
		the Doctor we aren&#39;t running a fitness gym he assured me it was all for science. Ensign Jaino
		had come to sickbay with a broken leg five minutes ago, the bone sticking out of the skin. The
		Doctor speculated that due to the effects of the cloud of organic matter, Jaino&#39;s body had
		healed at an unprecedented rate. Castle gagged a bit. After what happened to him on Explodus, I
		don&#39;t blame him. Castle agreed, loudly, that these things, Specs, he began calling them, could
		be capable of anything.</p> <p class="mb-4">Chief Trainer came on the view screen with a priority message. Crewmembers in Bioengineering
		were communicating with the Specs. Trainer told us that the Specs yelled, whistled, talked to
		each other, talked to the humans, they called out to their leader. Castle informed Trainer that
		we heard them on the bridge as well but not to that extent. Mr. Trainer requested to come to the
		bridge so that I may speak to the Spec that had infected him. Trainer warned me that his Spec
		was aggressively Napoleonic.</p> <p class="mb-4">Once Trainer came onto the bridge, the voices started twittering, cheering, and roaring. It was
		mildly annoying. I addressed myself to the Spec infecting Chief Trainer. It explained its plan
		in detail and its reasons for taking over my ship. The Specs, who called themselves the
		Lclalies, were going to take us to Dextrous Cannus to destroy their enemies, the Xxuzula. I
		confidently addressed the Lclalie and questioned why we would fight this war for them. The sly
		little thing laughed.</p> <p class="mb-4">The First Officer walked to the drive console with heavy feet, his arms swung wildly. Worry was
		painted on his face, his mouth clamped shut. He punched in coordinates. I ordered him to halt,
		but he slammed his fist onto the console, initiating a jump to Dextrous Cannus. Dextrous Cannus,
		was a known system with five planets where only one of the planets was made of solid matter,
		OP-93. Last time the system was catalogued there were no life forms present.</p> <p class="mb-4">The Lclalies cheered. Castle gasped and hugged himself as he apologized for disobeying an order.
		The leader of the Lclalies reminded me they would use us as weapons to destroy the Xxuzula and
		there was nothing we could do to stop them.</p> <br/> <br/> <p class="mb-4">Without warning, the entire bridge crew was beamed down to OP-93. I called back to Definitive,
		and the Warp Chief reported that she moved outside of her own control. I ordered her to beam us
		back but she regretfully could not complete the order. She could not lift her hands above the
		beaming console. I contacted Dr. Orlando and gave him control of the bridge until we were able
		to beam back.</p> <p class="mb-4">The ever-present Lclalies told us we were standing in the middle of hostile territory and that
		in order to survive, we must fight. They said the Xxuzula were fierce, frightening, unforgiving
		warriors with no remorse or conscience. The Xxuzula were, in simple terms, killers.</p> <p class="mb-4">Castle was trying to make himself vomit out the Lclalie inside of him. His Lclalie laughed and
		assured him that it was deeper in his body than that. We had no weapons, we had no defense. How
		would we survive against such skilled and terrifying creatures?</p> <p class="mb-4">Off in the distance we noticed circular lights flashing and quickly bouncing toward us. I looked
		to First Officer Castle. He shook his head in disbelief. The Lclalies gave a battle cry and
		awkwardly moved members of the bridge crew toward the lights. First Officer Castle shuddered at
		the sight. After what happened to him on Cenjal, I don&#39;t blame him.</p> <p class="mb-4">The Xxuzula were actually clusters of handball-sized lights. As they approached, they shot
		energy beams from the middle of their torso-sized bodies. As the beams struck a rock formation
		next to the crew, they fell to the ground for cover. The Lclalies demanded we fight, fight or
		die. Castle lurched toward the Xxuzula and kicked one, sending it up into the air, it went
		higher and higher until it disappeared into the sky. He buried his hands into another and ripped
		it in two pieces that dissipated quickly, the light dying.</p> <p class="mb-4">Chief Trainer pulled Castle away from attacking another Xxuzula and then was struck himself by
		an energy blast. He did not fall to the ground. Instead he looked back to me, shrugged his
		shoulder, and then looked at the Xxuzula. It fired at Trainer again. It struck him again and
		puffed away into nothing.</p> <p class="mb-4">I called to the crewmembers who were laying on the ground. They were dazed by the blast but
		other wise uninjured. The Xxuzula stopped firing on us and backed away. The Lclalies yelled for
		us to keep attacking, they moved our arms, our legs toward the Xxuzula.</p> <br/> <br/> <p class="mb-4">The Doctor called down and excitedly explained that he found a way to remove the Lclalies from
		our bodies. I ordered him to beam down immediately. Once Dr. Orlando was on the surface of the
		planet he extracted the Lclalie from each of us. He pushed a pinky-sized needle into everyone
		and followed it up with a spritz to close the wound. When he came to me—I swear that it was
		completely and utterly involuntary—I slapped him. The Lclalie inside me screamed and struggled
		as the Doctor removed it.</p> <p class="mb-4">I assured the Xxuzula that humans were not their enemy and that the Lclalies were controlling
		our bodies. I apologized for First Officer Castle&#39;s deadly uncontrollable attack. The Lclalies
		gathered into a cloud again, pulsed and swayed, and they spoke as one. They vowed they would
		destroy all of the Xxuzula, that they would be back and in control of a larger, more powerful
		creature. The Xxuzula all clumped together and formed one giant energy beam that disintegrated
		the whole of the Lclalies.</p> <p class="mb-4">The bridge crew and myself beamed back to Definitive. My recommendation moving forward is to set
		an observation satellite around the planet and monitor the Xxuzula. First Officer Castle agrees
		completely on the destruction of the Lclalies. I don&#39;t blame him.</p>`;return{c(){e=r("span"),e.innerHTML=o,this.h()},l(t){e=h(t,"SPAN",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(e)!=="svelte-76de6d"&&(e.innerHTML=o),this.h()},h(){d(e,"class","w-2/3 max-w-md")},m(t,s){c(t,e,s)},p:a,i:a,o:a,d(t){t&&m(e)}}}class b extends u{constructor(e){super(),p(this,e,null,w,n,{})}}export{b as component};
