                  Sol System date 2405.16.6.3<br />
                  Captain Amber Paisley<br />
                  Explorer Fleet Starship Definitive
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  While observing the planet Apex Nine in the Outer Straus
                  System, a mysterious cloud of organic matter, comprised mostly
                  of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, appeared near the
                  ship. It moved like ocean waves. Quickly the cloud surrounded
                  the ship and seeped inside.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I put all decks on high alert. Kalal Trainer, Chief of
                  Bioengineering, confirmed that the cloud matter was everywhere
                  inside the ship. He listed everywhere it was, in the air, the
                  water, the food, and our clothes, right now, right here it was
                  on our skin. There was no doubt that it was inside all of us.
                  Trainer told me he was almost positive that there was no
                  threat. He would run more tests to see what else may lay in
                  their elemental makeup.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I lowered the ship-wide alert to yellow. I trusted Chief
                  Trainer, but I needed the Doctor involved as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Doctor, Tom Orlando, had already heard everything about
                  the cloud but was more concerned with the recovery of nine of
                  his patients quarantined with Blargius Muscle Flu from a prior
                  mission to Nelves Titan. Those infected with Blargius Muscle
                  Flu had a one in four chance of death and symptoms that kept
                  the patient bedridden until they passed on or recovered with
                  lifelong tissue scarring. The real problem was that those
                  affected with the flu were fully recovered and showed no signs
                  of ever being infected by the virus.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I liked to think that having my nine crewmembers back to work
                  wasn't a problem, but the Doctor didn't see it the same way. I
                  reminded him that since the flu was no longer a threat to
                  their health, he could get to work on the cloud substance's
                  affects without disruption. I chose to ignore his mumblings
                  about “real” priorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While I was content in waiting for Trainer and Orlando's
                  conclusions, my First Officer, Sam Castle, expressed his
                  distaste for me not taking the organic matter more seriously.
                  Castle reminded me that the organic matter was inside our
                  bodies. Castle's concerns were exacerbated due to a phobia of
                  “body snatchers.” After what happened to him on Shalous, I
                  don't blame him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was at this point that I thought I heard a tinny, small
                  voice on the bridge. It was hard to tell what language it was,
                  but I'm sure some of it was English. Something
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  about final destruction of them. Castle heard a different
                  voice; he described his as being deep and slow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Doctor came on the view screen. Before he could get a word
                  out I asked if he had heard any voices. He recommended me for
                  a brain scan and psychotics medication. Behind Dr. Orlando
                  there was an Ensign Jaino doing jumping jacks, running in
                  place, and doing cartwheels. After reminding the Doctor we
                  aren't running a fitness gym he assured me it was all for
                  science. Ensign Jaino had come to sickbay with a broken leg
                  five minutes ago, the bone sticking out of the skin. The
                  Doctor speculated that due to the effects of the cloud of
                  organic matter, Jaino's body had healed at an unprecedented
                  rate. Castle gagged a bit. After what happened to him on
                  Explodus, I don't blame him. Castle agreed, loudly, that these
                  things, Specs, he began calling them, could be capable of
                  anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Chief Trainer came on the view screen with a priority message.
                  Crewmembers in Bioengineering were communicating with the
                  Specs. Trainer told us that the Specs yelled, whistled, talked
                  to each other, talked to the humans, they called out to their
                  leader. Castle informed Trainer that we heard them on the
                  bridge as well but not to that extent. Mr. Trainer requested
                  to come to the bridge so that I may speak to the Spec that had
                  infected him. Trainer warned me that his Spec was aggressively
                  Napoleonic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once Trainer came onto the bridge, the voices started
                  twittering, cheering, and roaring. It was mildly annoying. I
                  addressed myself to the Spec infecting Chief Trainer. It
                  explained its plan in detail and its reasons for taking over
                  my ship. The Specs, who called themselves the Lclalies, were
                  going to take us to Dextrous Cannus to destroy their enemies,
                  the Xxuzula. I confidently addressed the Lclalie and
                  questioned why we would fight this war for them. The sly
                  little thing laughed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The First Officer walked to the drive console with heavy feet,
                  his arms swung wildly. Worry was painted on his face, his
                  mouth clamped shut. He punched in coordinates. I ordered him
                  to halt, but he slammed his fist onto the console, initiating
                  a jump to Dextrous Cannus. Dextrous Cannus, was a known system
                  with five planets where only one of the planets was made of
                  solid matter, OP-93. Last time the system was catalogued there
                  were no life forms present.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Lclalies cheered. Castle gasped and hugged himself as he
                  apologized for disobeying an order. The leader of the Lclalies
                  reminded me they would use us as weapons to destroy the
                  Xxuzula and there was nothing we could do to stop them.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  Without warning, the entire bridge crew was beamed down to
                  OP-93. I called back to Definitive, and the Warp Chief
                  reported that she moved outside of her own control. I ordered
                  her to beam us back but she regretfully could not complete the
                  order. She could not lift her hands above the beaming console.
                  I contacted Dr. Orlando and gave him control of the bridge
                  until we were able to beam back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ever-present Lclalies told us we were standing in the
                  middle of hostile territory and that in order to survive, we
                  must fight. They said the Xxuzula were fierce, frightening,
                  unforgiving warriors with no remorse or conscience. The
                  Xxuzula were, in simple terms, killers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Castle was trying to make himself vomit out the Lclalie inside
                  of him. His Lclalie laughed and assured him that it was deeper
                  in his body than that. We had no weapons, we had no defense.
                  How would we survive against such skilled and terrifying
                  creatures?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Off in the distance we noticed circular lights flashing and
                  quickly bouncing toward us. I looked to First Officer Castle.
                  He shook his head in disbelief. The Lclalies gave a battle cry
                  and awkwardly moved members of the bridge crew toward the
                  lights. First Officer Castle shuddered at the sight. After
                  what happened to him on Cenjal, I don't blame him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Xxuzula were actually clusters of handball-sized lights.
                  As they approached, they shot energy beams from the middle of
                  their torso-sized bodies. As the beams struck a rock formation
                  next to the crew, they fell to the ground for cover. The
                  Lclalies demanded we fight, fight or die. Castle lurched
                  toward the Xxuzula and kicked one, sending it up into the air,
                  it went higher and higher until it disappeared into the sky.
                  He buried his hands into another and ripped it in two pieces
                  that dissipated quickly, the light dying.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Chief Trainer pulled Castle away from attacking another
                  Xxuzula and then was struck himself by an energy blast. He did
                  not fall to the ground. Instead he looked back to me, shrugged
                  his shoulder, and then looked at the Xxuzula. It fired at
                  Trainer again. It struck him again and puffed away into
                  nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I called to the crewmembers who were laying on the ground.
                  They were dazed by the blast but other wise uninjured. The
                  Xxuzula stopped firing on us and backed away. The Lclalies
                  yelled for us to keep attacking, they moved our arms, our legs
                  toward the Xxuzula.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  The Doctor called down and excitedly explained that he found a
                  way to remove the Lclalies from our bodies. I ordered him to
                  beam down immediately. Once Dr. Orlando was on the surface of
                  the planet he extracted the Lclalie from each of us. He pushed
                  a pinky-sized needle into everyone and followed it up with a
                  spritz to close the wound. When he came to me—I swear that it
                  was completely and utterly involuntary—I slapped him. The
                  Lclalie inside me screamed and struggled as the Doctor removed
                  it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I assured the Xxuzula that humans were not their enemy and
                  that the Lclalies were controlling our bodies. I apologized
                  for First Officer Castle's deadly uncontrollable attack. The
                  Lclalies gathered into a cloud again, pulsed and swayed, and
                  they spoke as one. They vowed they would destroy all of the
                  Xxuzula, that they would be back and in control of a larger,
                  more powerful creature. The Xxuzula all clumped together and
                  formed one giant energy beam that disintegrated the whole of
                  the Lclalies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The bridge crew and myself beamed back to Definitive. My
                  recommendation moving forward is to set an observation

                  Henry pointed his laser pistol over his head and blindly fired
                  a pair of warning shots out of the broken windows of his
                  apartment. He yelled loud enough to make sure the cops on the
                  street heard him. "Just turn around and leave!"
                </p>
                <p>
                  The sound of a loudspeaker crackled, and a cop's distorted
                  voice boomed into the room. "We want to resolve this
                  peacefully, Henry. Nobody has to get hurt."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Ogre's blood! It's too late for that," Henry yelled. The
                  thought of a standoff with the police had seemed exciting at
                  first, but it was terrifying now that he was in the middle of
                  it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "You know what kind of firepower we have," the cop said,
                  sounding like he was talking through gritted teeth. "If we
                  wanted to storm in there and take you out, you wouldn't be
                  able to stop us."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Henry laughed bitterly. "You and I both know you won't do it,"
                  he yelled. "You wouldn't want to damage the goods." Henry
                  checked the power meter on his pistol. It was down to a
                  quarter charge. He guessed it was enough to hold them off for
                  another hour, at most. The whole situation felt like the time
                  his guild, the Shatterkin, valiantly fought and lost to the
                  orcs at Bloodridge Pass.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Keep thinking that," the cop said. "We have to bring you in
                  alive, but your face doesn't have to be in one piece--" The
                  bullhorn cut off mid-sentence, like someone yanked it out of
                  the cop's hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Henry dreaded this day ever since Congress passed the TRIBAL
                  Act. After years of the mainstream media reporting on the
                  dwindling numbers of Navajo, it was inevitable that the nanny
                  state would pass a law requiring people with Navajo ancestry
                  to procreate. Henry happened to be one hundred percent Navajo,
                  and now he was facing a future of involuntary servitude as a
                  father.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Give them hell, Dragonstar!" The voice of Steelhorn came
                  through on his earbuds. Only Henry's brothers-in-arms knew him
                  as Dragonstar, his character name in the online role-playing
                  game Eldritch Curse. The physical world was a boring place of
                  meaningless shit, and Henry's true place in life was inside
                  the game. Steelhorn was Henry's Shatterkin guild mate, raiding
                  partner, and the best friend Henry ever had.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Thanks, Steelhorn," Henry said. He glanced at the
                  recently-purchased cameras stuck to the walls inside his
                  apartment. He was live-streaming the confrontation. "How's it
                  looking on social media?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Yeah man, you know, we got people on your side. Lots,"
                  Steelhorn said.
                </p>
                <p>"Tell it to me straight, sword-brother," Henry said.</p>
                <p>
                  "Fuck," Steelhorn said. "It's split thirty-to-seventy against
                  you. The fucking sheeple want the goddamn feds to run
                  everybody's life."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Henry's heart sank. The plan was a failure. Henry had wanted
                  to make a run for the Mexican border, but Steelhorn had
                  convinced him that a standoff with the police was his best
                  shot. It was supposed to inspire enough public support to
                  overturn the TRIBAL Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Listen," Steelhorn said. "It doesn't matter. Fuck those
                  people. You have to keep fighting for yourself. Blacknight
                  blades stand strong!"
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Blacknight blades stand strong!" Henry said. It was their
                  battle cry. Henry tried hard to sound confident.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Henry, let's take a step back and try this from the
                  beginning. Clean slate." It was the cop on the bullhorn again.
                  His calm voice sounded forced, a weak dam holding back an
                  angry flood of cursing. "What do you say?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Fuck off, goblin spawn!" Henry yelled. His voice cracked. He
                  was getting hoarse from all the yelling.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The cop ignored the insult. "We've got seven ladies out here
                  who would like to meet you. All of them are full-blooded
                  Navajo, just like you. I'm going to let them tell you about
                  themselves."
                </p>
                <p>
                  The bullhorn crackled with static, and a woman spoke. "Hi
                  Henry, my name is Debbie. I've lived in the Navajo Nation my
                  whole life. I teach Biology at Diné College, and I know I will
                  make a wonderful mother."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "You're fat and ugly," Henry yelled without bothering to look.
                  Who knows, maybe she was fat and ugly. It did not matter to
                  him. Besides, he was sure a police sniper was outside just
                  waiting for an opportunity to take Henry down with a
                  tranquilizer gun.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The cop jumped back on the bullhorn. "Listen here asshole, you
                  show these women some respect. They're doing their duty to
                  save your people."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "They aren't my people!" Henry yelled. His parents left the
                  reservation before he was born, and Henry lived a typical
                  white bread suburban fucking American-dream life. He knew
                  nothing about his ancestry and he did not care. "My people are
                  the Shatterkin of the Windy Wilds."
                </p>
                <p>
                  The bullhorn cut off, but Henry could hear the cop's distant
                  voice saying, "What the fuck does that mean?"
                </p>
                <p>"Steelhorn," Henry said. "What do I do, man?"</p>
                <p>
                  "That depends on how far you're willing to go," Steelhorn
                  said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Henry felt sick to his stomach. "I'm not going to kill
                  anybody."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Fine, fine. I wouldn't recommend it anyway." Steelhorn said.
                  "Dragonstar, you gotta think about what they want from you.
                  They're going to try to make you have babies with all those
                  women out there to preserve the race."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I don't want to raise any kids," Henry said. He would never
                  have time to play Eldritch Curse if he had to take care of a
                  bunch of his own little bastards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I know you don't," Steelhorn said. "But listen, they want a
                  biological father to raise the kids. See what I'm getting at?"
                </p>
                <p>"No," Henry said.</p>
                <p>
                  "They won't have any need for you if you can't make babies,"
                  Steelhorn said. "So all you got to do is blow off your balls."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "What?" Henry's voice went up two octaves. He felt a tingling
                  sensation in his crotch.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "No sperm, no kids, and you keep your freedom." Steelhorn said
                  it so calmly, like he was discussing the benefits of dragon
                  armor versus regular steel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "No fucking way," Henry said. "You're out of your elf-forsaken
                  mind."
                </p>
                <p>"It's your only option," Steelhorn said.</p>
                <p>
                  The cop came back on the bullhorn. "I'm getting tired of this.
                  You can do this the fun way, or we can strap you down and have
                  a doctor jam a big fat needle into your testicles. Your
                  choice. Five minutes and we're coming in there to get you."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "You can't argue them down," Steelhorn said. "They've made up
                  their minds, and they aren't going to let you have a say. You
                  have to blow off your balls."
                </p>
                <p>Henry's heart beat faster. "I can't..."</p>
                <p>
                  "Shh," Steelhorn said. "Don't worry buddy, I'll talk you
                  through it. Just put the gun barrel against your balls."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Henry was shaking, but he did as Steelhorn instructed. He held
                  the laser pistol with both hands to keep it steady. The thin
                  fabric of his pants did nothing to soften the cold hard steel
                  pressing against his sensitive scrotum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Put your finger on the trigger," Steelhorn said. A bead of
                  sweat rolled down the side of Henry's face.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "On three, you're going to pull the trigger," Steelhorn said.
                  Henry gritted his teeth. "One...two...THREE!"
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Argh!" Henry pointed the gun at the wall. "I can't do it!"
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Goddammit Dragonstar!" Steelhorn said. "Once you're in
                  custody, you're going to have people watching over you
                  twenty-four seven. You'll never get a moment of free time, and
                  you'll never be able to play Eldritch Curse again. They'll
                  turn you into livestock."
                </p>
                <p>"Three minutes," the cop said.</p>
                <p>
                  Steelhorn spoke forcefully in his ear. "Blow. Off. Your
                  balls."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Henry jammed the gun against his crotch again, and his finger
                  caressed the trigger. He swallowed.
                </p>
                <p>"Blacknight blades stand strong!" Steelhorn said.</p>
                <p>"Blacknight blades stand strong!" Henry said.</p>
                <p>
                  The two of them chanted in unison. "Blacknight blades stand
                  strong! Blacknight blades stand strong!"
                </p>
                <p>
                  Henry screamed. He was going to do it. Fuck the cops. Fuck the
                  system. His finger hovered over the trigger.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Sike Dehaaya turned off the holotape. The simulation dissolved
                  and the rocky surface of Mars reappeared around him. His young
                  Navajo students blinked as their vision adjusted to the bright
                  reddish haze of the sunny Martian afternoon. He took a deep
                  breath of the terraformed air and sighed. Revisiting the past
                  always left him in awe of the strange lives led by his distant
                  ancestors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "And that is how the genetic purity of our tribe was preserved
                  by the great man known as Henry Wilkins," Sike said. "Any
                  questions?"
