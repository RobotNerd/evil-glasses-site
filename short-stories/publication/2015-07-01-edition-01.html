                <p>
                  Her hands were never pretty and she never cared for them to
                  be. Even with such tough skin her fingers were still slender.
                  In gloves they would be the regular hands of a young woman
                  with an average face.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When she smiled she was pretty. When she smiled it didn't
                  matter that she was so plain looking. When she smiled even
                  couldn't look at herself and think that she was nothing short
                  of fetching.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The smile that made her pretty hadn't been around for a while.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She rubbed her arm, slowly moving her scarred hand up to
                  massage her shoulder. The muscles were firm and dense. She
                  walked from the backdoor through the kitchen rustling the dirt
                  on the floor. Her right hand went up her shirt to help her
                  left arm out of her dirty, sweaty tank top. The days used to
                  cause her to sigh in relief once she got home. But lately she
                  hadn't had any feelings. She didn't like, love, or hate it.
                  She just did it because it was who she was and who she grew up
                  to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She slid her feet into her house slippers and went down the
                  hall to the bathroom knocking one knuckle on the closed door
                  she passed. One switch to the right turned on the small, dim
                  light above the dirty mirror. She picked up her toothbrush,
                  squeezed out less paste than she should have, and brushed her
                  teeth for the full two minutes, even her tongue. She worked
                  water on her face and when she lifted her head to dry her face
                  she noticed the water left clean streak down her dirty neck.
                  She rubbed the water on her neck and picked up the towel on
                  the floor. She smelled it. It had a damp metallic smell but
                  she used it anyway. She dropped the towel on the floor,
                  stepped out of her house slippers, undid her belt, unbuttoned
                  her pants, and took them off leaving them on the floor next to
                  the towel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With her slippers back on she went back to the living room. As
                  the end of the purple sky disappeared from the window she
                  turned on the light. The floor was dirty there too. The living
                  room had a three-cushion couch, coffee table, a pile of
                  yellowing newspapers, and a black AM/FM radio. She turned on
                  the radio, already on talk, and brushed off the couch where
                  her head laid.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She sat down and closed her eyes. The heavy feeling was making
                  her neck weak. She felt her breath go heavy and snapped open
                  her eyes. A yawn pulled her eyes shut again and she was
                  thirsty. She knew that she should get up and get a glass of
                  water to leave on the coffee table while she slept. She
                  thought about it, saw herself getting the glass and blowing
                  out the dirt, filling it with water from the sink in the half
                  light from the living room, and taking it back with her half
                  drank already. She decided to turn the light off instead. The
                  voices of the radio filled the dark room.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With no curtains on the windows the volcano was always in
                  clear sight. She never noticed it unless she made herself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One more deep breath and she made her place on the couch to go
                  to sleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She woke without an alarm. She didn't even have a clock. Time
                  never mattered much in her life. When she was a kid her father
                  made it clear that if the sun was up she should be working and
                  if the sun was going down it was time to head home. If the
                  moon was out it was time to go to bed. It was her way of life
                  as set by her dad.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The sun had yet to break over the mountains and she was up
                  making coffee with the left over coffee from the day before
                  mixed in with more tap water. Her tin of coffee was on its
                  last pot and she sighed at the thought of having to go into
                  town. She would need more than coffee to go into town though.
                  The line was drawn somewhere at toilet paper and the last few
                  packs of top ramen noodles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The journey to town took a whole day away from the volcano,
                  which always made her nervous. Her bike was good enough for
                  the three miles to the closest, rarely used bus station where
                  the timing was hit or miss. Then the practically empty white,
                  rusted bus would drive over the rubble paths for ten more
                  miles. And finally the one transfer to the more used bus into
                  the small town of about 5,000 people.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Food and tools were the only supplies she ever bought. Lots of
                  cans, lots of dry goods. Meats, fruits, and vegetables were
                  always planned on the bus ride so that anything she bought was
                  never wasted. She always made checks of the house and her
                  tools in case she needed anything to repair them. New handles,
                  new bolts, new pick and hammer heads. Window screens for the
                  summers, thread and needles for holes. She would drop off a
                  large amount of money with the post office to cover water and
                  electricity. Everything she did away from home and work was
                  planned and she did it as quick as she could.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Do you remember what this is?” Her dad had held up a small
                  clear pebble. “This is it what we need. This.” She took it in
                  her small, soft hand and studied it. “This is why we're here.”
                  He told her.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The towns people knew who she was, knew who her father was.
                  They understood very little about her job but knew that when
                  she came to town she wasn't going to talk to them, have lunch
                  at the diner, ask if everyone was doing alright, or see if
                  they needed anything from her. She was there to get food and
                  tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But for now she leaned against the counter of the small
                  kitchen and drank her black coffee, no sugar. She'd run out of
                  that a month ago. She stared in the direction of the volcano.
                  Even though she couldn't see it she knew its shape. Knew the
                  left side was steeper than the right. Knew that there was chip
                  out of the cone. Knew where the handful of weeds grew. She
                  could walk in the middle of a moonless night to where she left
                  off her work and start again with out tripping. Her life had
                  been spent on that volcano. The violent explosion of earth was
                  not hers to have and she understood that very well.
                </p>
                <p>“It's ours isn't it, Dad?” she once asked her father.</p>
                <p>
                  He smiled down at her as they walked up the volcano, a pickaxe
                  dragging behind her, both hands around the handle. “No
                  sweetie. It doesn't belong to anyone. It's the Earth. No one
                  can own it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The only thing that she claimed as hers were the minerals that
                  came from the lava. Her father rationalized the selling of the
                  minerals because they could help people. And they couldn't
                  continue to help people if they didn't have food. And money
                  bought food. She didn't know of material goods. The only
                  things they celebrated were their birthdays and they
                  celebrated with a trip to the coastline.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She loved the coastline, the salty smell and the seaweed that
                  would wash up on the white fine sand. It was so opposite her
                  everyday life. She dug out the sand crabs and showed every one
                  of them to her father. When she was older she would stand in
                  the water and try her hardest to hold herself still as the
                  waves crashed onto her shoulders. Her dad would sit on the
                  sand and often nap when she wasn't next to him talking.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Her father loved her immensely. His love never made her ask
                  what other little girls did in their day. She never wondered
                  why she didn't have friends. She didn't wonder if she wasn't
                  the only kid that didn't go to school and work all day and
                  read the paper at night. She didn't think that she was the
                  only one that knew everything about rocks and minerals. She
                  never truly wondered why she didn't have a mother either. He
                  loved her enough for a whole family. He said I love you
                  everyday. When her hands hurt and had open wounds to where she
                  couldn't lift her axe anymore he would let her know it was
                  fine to go home, but she never did until they could both walk
                  home together. As he continued to work she would lie out on
                  the black rock and sing what she could remember from the
                  latest song on the radio.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The world was the two of them. When it was time to walk back
                  on those days that she was too tired or hurt to finish work,
                  he would carry her back. She would be asleep in his arms by
                  the time they reached the house. He'd lay her down in her bed,
                  kiss her forehead, and sleep on the couch since the small
                  house only had one room.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She poured the last of her coffee down the drain and walked to
                  the bathroom, past the only room in the house. The bedroom
                  door was closed and all she did was hit one knuckle against
                  the hollow wood. Once in the bathroom she brushed her teeth as
                  well as she did before. She rinsed her face and ran her wet
                  hands through her hair to help tie it up in a neater ponytail.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She knew her whole day of work would be consumed with the
                  thoughts of going to town. What supplies she needed. Her hands
                  held on to the rim of the sink and she stared at the uncovered
                  drain. Nothing went through her head for half a second and she
                  closed her eyes hoping the sun had come up, that it was time
                  to go outside, breathe the air, and take her first steps of
                  the day on the volcano.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She left the bathroom not looking in the mirror again. Once in
                  the living room she knew the sun hadn't broken yet. A
                  three-week-old paper was on the top of a stack and she picked
                  it up as she went to sit on the dusty couch. None of the
                  articles mattered anymore. They never mattered to her in the
                  first place. But it was something to do and a habit. On the
                  short side of ten minutes the sun came over the mountains and
                  she walked out of the back door, grabbed her pickaxe from the
                  porch, and headed out to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She didn't make any progress on her path so she moved to the
                  mineral pits. She worked on clearing them of their tiny rocks
                  and trying to plan out her next spot to carve. The sun was on
                  its back end and she made her way down, stopping to check at
                  cracks as she went. Half way down she noticed a person walking
                  toward her.
                </p>
                <p>
                  No one ever went up here. No one. Ever. She wasn't counting on
                  a confrontation but knew the strength she had in her arms. As
                  they got closer to each other she saw that it was a man. He
                  waved his arm to catch her attention. She kept walking down,
                  checking her lines and walking. He cupped his hands around his
                  mouth and yelled something she couldn't understand. There was
                  no sort of communication she wished to engage in so she did
                  nothing. They got closer and she could understand his yells.
                </p>
                <p>“Hello.”</p>
                <p>
                  She was annoyed that that's all he was yelling. Again she did
                  nothing. The man jogged up so that she could finally see his
                  features and hear his panting from the jog.
                </p>
                <p>“Hi.” He let out a loud breath and smiled.</p>
                <p>
                  She looked at him and nodded her head. He nodded his head back
                  and had an expectant look on his face for something more. She
                  looked his face over while fighting her curiosity to look at
                  the rest of him. Questions flooded her brain as she focused on
                  his eyes. Brown, big, bright. Happy and smiling. What was he
                  doing there? Why did he bother to come all the way out there?
                  Why was he talking to her? Why was he there so late? She
                  didn't ask any of these questions but her heart fluttered and
                  her neck heated up. She turned her head and continued toward
                  home her distance from him.
                </p>
                <p>He made a sound but she did not turn back to him.</p>
                <p>
                  When she got home she locked the door behind her and proceeded
                  with her nightly routine. The thought of what he was doing
                  took the place of her trip to town. She hoped he wasn't dead
                  up there. She didn't want to drag down his body. Why did he
                  care to talk to her? His expecting but soft smile burned in
                  her eyes as she closed them to wash her face. His brown eyes.
                  She had to remember where she lived. Volcanoes are rare. He
                  was there to see the volcano of course. She just so happened
                  to be the volcano farmer that he came across.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Early in the morning she was at her same spot from the day
                  before. Yesterday the looming thought of town stopped her but
                  today it was the man. She thought of walking where he might
                  have walked to make sure he wasn't caught in a crack with a
                  broken leg bleeding out. But she didn't. He would at least be
                  screaming if something like that happened and he was still
                  alive. She heard no screams.
                </p>
                <p>“Hello again!”</p>
                <p>She jumped and dropped her axe.</p>
                <p>
                  “I'm sorry for scaring you!” He was thirty feet away but spoke
                  clearly.
                </p>
                <p>She caught her breath and bent to pick up her axe.</p>
                <p>
                  He waved his hand apologetically and a half smile took his
                  mouth. “I'm very sorry.” He continued to approach her.
                </p>
                <p>“You don't have to talk to me. I don't own the volcano.”</p>
                <p>
                  He stopped three yards from her. His mouth hung open in
                  question until he realized what she meant. “That wasn't my
                  intention. Not like I was just going to come here and not say
                  anything to you, you know? I mean I saw you and just didn't
                  want to walk by like you didn't exist.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  She looked at his teeth when he smiled. They were nice.
                  “Okay.” She said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He shaded his eyes from the sun and nodded his head. “Okay.”
                </p>
                <p>They stood facing each other silently.</p>
                <p>“You do this?” He asked.</p>
                <p>“Do what?”</p>
                <p>
                  “Work up here. Is that your house?” He motioned behind
                  himself.
                </p>
                <p>“Yes.”</p>
                <p>“By yourself?”</p>
                <p>
                  She eyed him and turned her left shoulder in a bit to guard
                  herself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Just wondering! I mean just asking. It's weird. Well, not too
                  weird.” He looked to the black rock ground. “There's no one
                  else out here, so I meant do you do this by yourself?”
                </p>
                <p>She didn't answer him.</p>
                <p>“It looks like a tough job.”</p>
                <p>
                  She heard the sympathy in his voice. “It's all I know and I'm
                  good at it.” At that open gate she ventured to look closer at
                  his features, his body.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His muscles were lean and skin very tan. He was very clean.
                </p>
                <p>“I have a tough job too.” He said.</p>
                <p>
                  She watched his lips. They were thick but fit his square jaw.
                  “Okay. I have to get back to work.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Yeah, yeah, yeah. You do what you have to.” He pointed up to
                  the volcano. “I'm just going to keep going up then.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  She nodded. He gave a small wave and smile as he passed her.
                  “You don't want to go with me do you?”
                </p>
                <p>“I need to work.” She said.</p>
                <p>
                  “Of course.” He smiled at her again and then turned to walk up
                  the volcano.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once he was clear of her she stooped down and looked from the
                  rock she was breaking to watch him walk away. She watched his
                  back and legs. She grabbed a handful of the pebbles and dust
                  then let it drop. She thought she should have smiled at him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hours later she noticed him coming down before he could scare
                  her with a greeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I'm in town,” he started right in, “for who knows how long.
                  Do you go often?”
                </p>
                <p>“No.”</p>
                <p>“Well when you do, maybe we can eat together?”</p>
                <p>“I don't go to town to eat.”</p>
                <p>
                  “Fair enough. Either way maybe I'll see you around.” He smiled
                  and made his way back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This time she didn't hide watching him on his walk down before
                  getting back to work.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  She sat down on her couch with the light on and ruffled
                  through the stack of newspapers. The date at the top was a
                  year and half ago. She opened it up, glanced at the top, and
                  her eyes fell to the middle on an article that she read
                  before.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Her and her father would go to town more often. He had more to
                  care about and for him it was a good way to break up the every
                  day so his daughter had more memories.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She was around ten when she met another boy in the grocery
                  store. She was roaming the store for things she wanted to eat
                  while her dad got supplies. They were both shy like kids are
                  shy but still curious. David was his name.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Her father smiled and let them play in the grocery store until
                  he was done.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Dad, I love David.” She looked up to him with a happy smile
                  as they got on the bus back to home.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “No, you don't love him,” he said kindly pulling her closer to
                  him. “I'm the only boy that you'll love.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Okay, Dad. I love you.” She buried her head into his side and
                  closed her eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She closed her eyes and sighed deep and she folded the paper
                  back up and put it aside. She clicked on the radio and clicked
                  off the light.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  A few days later she had to admit to herself that it was time
                  to go to town. No coffee, she needed an axe handle, no flour
                  or eggs for bread, she ate corn out of the can with no salt,
                  pepper or butter. She made her complete list and went to bed
                  with the worry of the trip. From two-thirty on she woke up
                  every half hour thinking about the ride to the bus, the
                  waiting, the things she would have to say to the people.
                  Hellos and thank yous. The I'm sorry for your loss, your
                  father would be proud, we all miss him. She thought about
                  seeing the brown eyed man on the street. What would he be
                  doing? She wondered how long he'd been in town and what he
                  did. She felt bad for not letting him tell her what he did.
                  She pictured how he would wave his hands and to get her
                  attention and if she would avoid him or go to him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She got up at 5:30 and pulled her bike and the cart off the
                  porch. She was waiting at the bus stop for the first bus by
                  6:45 and it didn't start running until 7:30.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She wasn't the only one at the stop by the time the rusted,
                  noisy, white bus showed up. There was an old woman with a
                  rolling handcart and an old man with gloves in his back
                  pocket.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ride was bumpy and loud along the poorly paved road. She
                  looked out of the window the whole ride. As she took the last
                  step off the bus from the long ride she watched the few people
                  that passed in front of her. She set out to the store with her
                  rolling cart behind her. The town's people looked at her and
                  if she looked at them they would smile. She did not. The store
                  didn't have everything she wanted but she was able to make
                  substitutions like twine instead of rope and a smaller hammer
                  instead of the correct size.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There was no small talk between her and the storeowner. She
                  gave him her dusty, gritty money and packed her supplies and
                  food in her cart. She pulled the cart behind her on the way to
                  the post office.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Oh my goodness, sweetie.” She heard it but kept on walking.
                  “Sweetheart!” She stopped and turned her head to an old woman,
                  pain shadowed the woman's face as she stepped closer. She did
                  no recognize the woman.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “You don't remember me then. That's fine. But I remember you.”
                  The woman came right to her side and put her boney yet soft
                  hand on her strong arm. “You haven't been into town for some
                  time.”
                </p>
                <p>“I didn't need to.”</p>
                <p>“There always comes a time. How are you doing up there?”</p>
                <p>“Fine.”</p>
                <p>
                  “Sweetie, I was your dad's school friend. Remember when I came
                  out to visit there toward the end?”
                </p>
                <p>“No.”</p>
                <p>
                  The woman pursed her lips and looked down to the ground. Her
                  hand was still on her arm. “Well I was there. It's good to see
                  you. You look healthy.”
                </p>
                <p>“Thank you.”</p>
                <p>
                  As much as the woman could squeeze, she squeezed to say
                  goodbye and began her painful walk again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She paid her utilities at the post office and began her walk
                  back to the bus stop. She passed the diner and there was knock
                  on the glass from the inside as she passed. It was him. He
                  waved his hand to coax her inside. She shook her head. He
                  stood up and walked outside leaving his half eaten plate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Hey, you're here.” He smiled. She didn't say anything. “Do
                  you want to join me? Are you hungry? I'm already eating but I
                  can hang out while you eat.”
                </p>
                <p>“No. I want to go back.”</p>
                <p>
                  He looked at her cart full of supplies then at his watch. “The
                  bus doesn't come by for another 40 minutes. Just a cup of
                  coffee or something while you wait?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  She looked at his arms and chest through his tee shirt. “Come
                  on,” he said cheerfully and opened up the door for her.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She slid into the booth opposite him. The waiter came by and
                  she asked for coffee and toast. He smiled at her. She looked
                  at his teeth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “My dad and I used to eat here when we came into town.” She
                  said.
                </p>
                <p>“Did you come into town more often then?”</p>
                <p>“Yes.”</p>
                <p>“Where's your dad?”</p>
                <p>“He died.”</p>
                <p>“I'm sorry to hear that.”</p>
                <p>
                  She drank her coffee. It tasted sweet even though it didn't
                  have any sugar. She ate the toast plain as well.
                </p>
                <p>“You don't like butter or sugar?”</p>
                <p>“I like them.”</p>
                <p>
                  “You just don't use them?” He moved the sugar bowl to the
                  middle of the table and pushed the small bowl with butter pads
                  a little closer to her. She didn't go for either. He went back
                  to eating his breakfast as she ate her toast.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The time ticked away slowly for her. She didn't look around
                  the diner too much and mostly focused her eyes to the outside.
                  He took a sip from his coffee then loudly scraped his plate
                  and she looked at him. “Sorry,” he said. She thought of her
                  dad as she sat with this man and missed the love he had for
                  her.
                </p>
                <p>“Why do you talk to me?” She asked.</p>
                <p>
                  He tilted his head at the question. “Honestly it looked like
                  you needed someone to talk to. Selfishly, I'm interested in
                  you.”
                </p>
                <p>The waiter came and refilled her coffee and left.</p>
                <p>“You're interested in the volcano.”</p>
                <p>He smiled. “No, I'm interested in you.”</p>
                <p>
                  She cracked a smile and his smile got bigger. She hid it
                  quickly.
                </p>
                <p>“You're just heading back home?” He asked.</p>
                <p>“Yes.” She looked out the window.</p>
                <p>“Can I come see you later?”</p>
                <p>“You can do whatever you want.”</p>
                <p>
                  He smiled at her and she didn't see it. “I'm more asking if I
                  go up there can we see each other?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  She turned her head to his smile. His brown eyes, white teeth,
                  tan skin. “What do you do?”
                </p>
                <p>“I'm a nautilus fisher.”</p>
                <p>
                  He waited for her to ask another question but she did not.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I'm on shore for a few months before going back out. This is
                  a new area for me. Me as in, it's just me. I don't have a
                  crew. My boat is little.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  She had not gone to the coast since her dad died. She missed
                  the waves crashing on her shoulders.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Luckily there are a lot of nautiluses off of this coast. I
                  made the right choice in coming out this way.”
                </p>
                <p>“How long have you been doing it?”</p>
                <p>
                  “Since I was a child. The town I'm from fishes them but
                  they've been declining. I had to try somewhere else.”
                </p>
                <p>“So you'll go back?”</p>
                <p>“Yes. Maybe. It's nice out here though.”</p>
                <p>
                  She shifted and pulled out a few dollars for the coffee and
                  toast.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “No, no I'd like to pay for it.” He reached for his wallet and
                  waved his hand in protest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She chose not to hear him and left the money on the table and
                  scooted out of the booth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “There's still time before the bus comes. Please stay just a
                  little longer.” He reached out and touched her hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Her heart raced at the touch and she looked at his hands. They
                  were rough, dry hands with calluses running along his fingers.
                  They were almost as scarred as hers. He smiled at her as he
                  watched her look at his hand.
                </p>
                <p>“It's not my volcano. You can come and go.” She said.</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  She unhooked her cart from her bike and pulled it up the steps
                  into the house. As she stacked her food in the bare cabinets
                  but it didn't get much fuller. She took her new stack of
                  newspapers and put them on the old. She knocked one knuckle on
                  the hollow door as she went to the tool closet. After putting
                  away everything she went out to continue her work. She thought
                  of the diner as she headed up. Her heart raced again thinking
                  about his hand on her. A fisherman.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Her dad's words, “I'm the only boy that you'll love.” She
                  couldn't remember the sound of his voice but the things he
                  said came often. She swung her axe down hard digging the pick
                  in deep. She struggled to loosen it. She gritted her teeth and
                  yanked on it, wiggled it, and pulled. It came loose. She swung
                  hard again and a large crack sprang open.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “His name was David.” She said to the crack. She swung again.
                  “I was little. What did it matter?” She swung again and the
                  head of the axe got wedged in the crack. She pulled the handle
                  and it didn't budge. She wrenched on it and pulled back and
                  forth and then the handle snapped from the head. She sighed
                  and stood still for a moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After breaking the axe handle she moved onto gathering small
                  rocks from another crack she had dug out. The sun was on it's
                  way west and she began her walk down with jars full of rocks.
                  She placed them on the kitchen counter and went about her
                  nightly routine. This time she had new papers to read so she
                  stayed up later than usual. She still woke at her usual time
                  and this time was able to make coffee.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She grabbed a new handle from the tool closet and set out for
                  the day. After the full day her hands ached and she had to
                  pull out a few slivers she got from the new handle. She gently
                  rubbed her palms as she walked back home. She saw him sitting
                  on the steps of her house.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Hi.” He stood and smiled. She said nothing. “I know you
                  didn't say that I could come over. I just wanted to give it
                  another try.” She stopped at the bottom stair.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Can we sit? Together I mean.” He sat back down so that she
                  looked down at him. The sunset made him look even darker.
                </p>
                <p>“How long have you been here?”</p>
                <p>
                  “Not long. I didn't want to scare you again by meeting you out
                  there. I actually wanted to come yesterday but that could have
                  been weird since we just saw each other. So today it is. At
                  night.”
                </p>
                <p>“Dusk.”</p>
                <p>“Yeah. So, will you sit with me?”</p>
                <p>
                  She looked at his arms and his face. She liked both. She
                  leaned her axe against the stairs and sat next to him on the
                  same step. His smile grew as she settled. A content sigh came
                  from him. She looked at the volcano, the chip from the cone,
                  the left side that was steeper than the right. The top of it
                  bathed in pink and orange light while the rest was dark blue.
                  She turned and looked at him. He turned and looked at her.
                </p>
                <p>“I'm Anna.”</p>
                <p>“My name is Miguel.”</p>
                <p>She smiled.</p>

                <p><strong>8/5 Wed</strong></p>

                <p>First day back at school, and it's already shit.</p>

                <p>
                  Ms. McReady--our cow of a biology teacher--forced us into
                  assigned seats. She sat me down beside this skeleton of a
                  girl. The girl had long stringy black hair, hunched shoulders,
                  and her clothes were almost falling off. She smelled gross. I
                  haven't smelled anything like it before. The best way I can
                  describe it is stale.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Then I realized who it was. Sandy. Holy shit! I must have
                  looked like an idiot, sitting there with my mouth wide open.
                  She had needed to lose weight, but damn she took it too far.
                  She had to have starved herself the entire summer to get that
                  small. I felt guilty. Maybe I shouldn't have called her a fat
                  bitch.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Whatever though. She needed to hear it. I looked at the front
                  of the room and tried to ignore her. She just sat there
                  staring straight ahead the whole time, acting like I didn't
                  exist.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Everything was fine until the bell rang. I wanted to get out
                  of the room, but when I grabbed my bag, Sandy looked at me. Oh
                  God, her eyes were sunken into her head. She wasn't really
                  looking at me, more like through me at something in the
                  distance. She looked so weak that I have no idea how she could
                  even move around.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Then her eyes focused on me, and she checked me out from head
                  to toe. She said, &quot;Why are you so fat?&quot; I gasped. It
                  felt like she dumped a bucket of ice water on me, and I was on
                  fire at the same time. And my skin felt odd, like something
                  was crawling all over me.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Sandy tried to smile, but it was forced. A tear rolled down
                  one of her cheeks.
                </p>

                <p>I ran away.</p>

                <p><strong>8/6 Thu</strong></p>

                <p>Sandy didn't show up to school today.</p>

                <p>
                  I told Amanda and Cici about what happened. Neither of them
                  have seen Sandy yet, so they don't know how bad she looks.
                  Amanda laughed about it. She said that it doesn't matter how
                  much weight Sandy loses, because being skinny won't improve
                  her face.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I said that maybe I had been too hard on Sandy, but Cici told
                  me Sandy was a weirdo. My choice to cut Sandy out was a
                  necessity, because being friends with her was social suicide.
                  I know Cici is right, but I still feel guilty. Sandy and I had
                  been close ever since we were little.
                </p>

                <p><strong>8/7 Fri</strong></p>

                <p>
                  I was grabbing stuff from my locker, and I felt someone behind
                  me. The stale smell was enough for me to know it was Sandy. I
                  glanced back at her and felt sick. She looked worse than
                  before.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I took a deep breath, faced her, and asked what she wanted.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Sandy clutched her notebook to her chest like a shield. I
                  thought she was going to cry. Instead, all she said was,
                  &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; I could barely hear her, she said it so
                  quietly. She turned around and walked away.
                </p>

                <p>I'm such a fucking asshole.</p>

                <p><strong>8/10 Mon</strong></p>

                <p>
                  No show again on Sandy. I thought it was going to be a normal
                  day. Stupid me.
                </p>

                  We were in the cafeteria for lunch. Pizza day. I didn't feel
                  like talking, so I left the conversation to Amanda and Cici.
                  Like usual.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the middle of a mouthful of pizza, I looked up and noticed
                  a creepy guy.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It was some gross old man. He must have been 60, at least. He
                  stood all the way on the other side of the cafeteria, so it
                  was hard to see him well. He looked bald and pale, and he was
                  wearing a dirty one-piece outfit that was almost the same
                  color as his skin. It was kind of like what a mechanic would
                  wear.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The creep was staring at me. Even from so far away, I could
                  feel his eyes crawling all over me. I was so disgusted I had
                  to spit out my food. Amanda and Cici were like WTF? I tried to
                  point him out, but he had disappeared. Scary. The school
                  should do background checks on their janitors.
                </p>

                <p>I lost my appetite after that.</p>

                <p><strong>8/11 Tue</strong></p>

                <p>
                  I've been sick all day. Mom said I had a fever. She tried to
                  give me chicken noodle soup, but I felt nauseous at the sight
                  of it. No school today.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It's late, and I'm feeling a little better. I'm still a little
                  queasy, but I think I can go back to school tomorrow. Mom
                  thinks I had food poisoning.
                </p>

                <p><strong>8/12 Wed</strong></p>

                <p>Sandy is dead.</p>

                <p>
                  Mr. Willard called an emergency school assembly in the
                  morning. He got up in front of everyone and told us that Sandy
                  had passed away on Monday. They brought in counselors to talk
                  to us.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Marisa Wright and Lorry Masterson were sitting behind me. I
                  could hear them whispering to each other. Marisa said that
                  Sandy had committed suicide, and that the school was worried
                  about other students killing themselves.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Lorry said that she heard it wasn't suicide. Sandy was
                  murdered. Some serial killer had gotten into her bedroom while
                  her whole family was asleep. Sandy had been cut up into a
                  bunch of pieces and all of her skin was taken.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Marisa said that was a bullshit story someone made up to start
                  an urban legend. They must have noticed me trying to
                  eavesdrop. They shut up after that.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I cut class for the rest of the day. I'm not talking to the
                  counselors.
                </p>

                <p><strong>8/13 Thu</strong></p>

                <p>I don't know what to do.</p>

                <p>
                  Dad cooked steak for supper. I was starving. Between being
                  sick and finding out about Sandy, I haven't been able to eat
                  anything since Monday.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We were all sitting at the dining room table, and I had just
                  put a piece of steak in my mouth. A horrible feeling came over
                  me, exactly like last week when Sandy called me fat. It was
                  like the beginning of a fever where your whole body aches, and
                  I felt sick like I had eaten spoiled food. There were
                  invisible tentacles running all over my skin.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I don't know why, but I looked over my shoulder and out
                  through the bay windows. The janitor from school was standing
                  on the other side of the street staring at me through the
                  windows. I almost threw up.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I screamed. Mom and Dad freaked. I tried to tell them about
                  the man standing outside, but I was crying and I couldn't get
                  the words out. I kept pointing at the windows and Dad went to
                  look. The guy ran off before Dad got out there.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Dad called the police, but they said there's nothing they can
                  do. Dad is taking off work tomorrow to go by the school with
                  me.
                </p>

                <p><strong>8/14 Fri</strong></p>

                <p>They don't have a new janitor at school.</p>

                <p>
                  Dad and I were sitting in Mr. Willard's office. I tried to
                  describe the creep to him, but Mr. Willard kept saying that
                  they hadn't hired anyone new. He and Dad kept eyeing each
                  other. As if I can't read body language.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I yelled at them for not believing me. Mr. Willard looked
                  right at me, and in the most condescending tone of voice, he
                  said, &quot;If someone like that was lurking around the
                  school, don't you think someone else would have noticed?&quot;
                </p>

                <p>
                  This is the worst day of my life. I haven't eaten anything and
                  I'm starving, but every time I think about that monster I get
                  sick to my stomach.
                </p>

                <p><strong>8/16 Sun</strong></p>

                <p>
                  I hid in my room all weekend. Mom and Dad tried to get me to
                  come out, but I faked being sick. They didn't believe me. Mom
                  tried to have a &quot;serious&quot; talk with me about Sandy,
                  but I told her I wasn't ready to talk about it yet.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Mom left food for me. I flushed it down the toilet when she
                  left. I'm so hungry, but just the thought of food makes me
                  want to puke.
                </p>

                <p><strong>8/17 Mon</strong></p>

                <p>
                  It happened in the sophomore hallway between second and third
                  period. I was so hungry that I had to eat something no matter
                  how sick I felt. I bought a bag of chips from the vending
                  machine.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As soon as I put the first chip in my mouth, that sick feeling
                  started again, the worms crawling over my skin. For some
                  reason I looked up...and there he was. The creepy guy. He was
                  standing at the far end of the hall, staring at me. The
                  hallway was packed, but everyone was walking around him.
                  Nobody even noticed him. It's like he was invisible to
                  everyone but me.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I felt like vomiting, but I didn't. I was so hungry. I stared
                  that fucker down and forced another chip in my mouth. When I
                  swallowed, he smiled.
                </p>

                <p>He took one step towards me.</p>

                <p>
                  My hands were shaking, but I wouldn't look away from him. I
                  pulled another chip out of the bag and ate it. When I
                  swallowed, he took another step forward. A long string of spit
                  came out of his mouth and dripped onto the floor.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I took my phone out of my bag. My hand was shaking when I took
                  a photo.
                </p>

                <p>
                  He wasn't in the image. He wasn't there at all! I looked over
                  my phone to double check, and he was definitely there. I took
                  another photo. Nothing. All the people around him showed up,
                  but not him.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I dropped the chips on the floor. I was shaking so bad that I
                  had to use both hands to steady the phone. Picture. Picture.
                  Picture. He was never visible in any of them.
                </p>

                <p>
                  That's when I noticed a small crowd had stopped to watch me. I
                  realized I was crying. I stuffed my phone back in my bag, and
                  I pointed at the man. The creature. They looked that way, and
                  then they looked right back at me. They looked confused. The
                  creature smiled.
                </p>

                <p>I ran away.</p>

                <p><strong>8/18 Tue</strong></p>

                <p>
                  I'm losing too much weight. My clothes don't fit right. I'm so
                  hungry I can't think straight.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Today went by in a blur. I stayed away from food but couldn't
                  stop thinking about it. Hamburgers, mac and cheese, fries, ice
                  cream. Every time I imagine taking a bite, I see the monster's
                  face smiling at me and taking one step closer. I'm so
                  miserable, I just want to shoot myself in the head.
                </p>

                <p>This is what happened to Sandy. It has to be.</p>

                <p><strong>8/19 Wed</strong></p>

                <p>
                  Mom made me sit down at dinner even though I said I was
                  feeling sick. I was so weak from hunger that I couldn't put up
                  a fight. She gave me a bowl of chicken soup.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I stared at it for a while. When I looked up, both Mom and Dad
                  were staring at me. They were worried but trying to hide it. I
                  made myself smile, and then I ate a spoonful of soup.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I felt him right away. Those slimy worms crawling under my
                  skin. The nausea. He was behind me again on the street. I
                  didn't look. I asked Dad if there was anyone outside behind
                  me.
                </p>

                <p>
                  He looked out the window, then back at me, and he shook his
                  head.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I ate more soup. It was so hard to keep it down. My stomach
                  was trying to vomit out everything I put in. It was such a
                  horrible feeling, the sickness and this insane hunger mixed
                  together.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When I finished, I looked back over my shoulder. The janitor
                  was standing at the edge of our lawn.
                </p>

                <p><strong>8/20 Thu</strong></p>

                <p>
                  Cici and Amanda cornered me in the girl's bathroom. I've been
                  avoiding them. Cici asked me what my problem was, and I told
                  them that I was sick. They called bullshit and said they knew
                  I wasn't eating. Amanda said that I was making them look bad
                  and that I better put myself together.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I cried. I tried to tell them about the man--the monster--but
                  I know I wasn't making sense. They just looked at me like I
                  was a stray dog. Cici kept shaking her head in disappointment.
                  I've never felt so ashamed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I finally gave up because I knew they wouldn't believe me.
                  They helped me clean up my face, and we left. They left me
                  alone for the rest of the day.
                </p>

                <p>I'm so hungry.</p>

                <p><strong>8/21 Fri</strong></p>

                <p>
                  I didn't talk at school today. Not a word to anyone. I didn't
                  feel like it. Dad had to work late and Mom couldn't put up
                  enough of a fight to force feed me.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I took a long look at myself in the mirror. By body is fading
                  away. I used to be so beautiful, but now my cheeks are hollow,
                  dark bags hang under my eyes, and my hair is stringy.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In a moment of weakness, I dug through the drawer looking for
                  a razor blade. I pulled it out before remembering it was a
                  cheap safety razor. Too hard to get the blade out.
                </p>

                <p>What the fuck is wrong with me? I don't want to die.</p>

                <p>Sandy. I need to find out what happened to Sandy.</p>

                <p><strong>8/22 Sat</strong></p>

                <p>
                  I used a knife from the kitchen to poke a new hole in my belt.
                  My pants are falling off.
                </p>

                <p>
                  While I was heading out the door, I grabbed a bagel. I tried
                  to act cheerful, and I yelled back at Mom that I was going to
                  the mall. Maybe she believed me. I threw the bagel in the
                  trash.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I drove to Sandy's neighborhood and parked a couple streets
                  away from her house. Kids were out riding bikes and playing
                  ball and stuff. It made me want to be little like that again.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Sandy's house was empty. Police tape crisscrossed the front
                  door. Her family must not have come back there since the
                  murder. I wonder if they will ever come back.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I found the special rock in the backyard, but I could barely
                  lift it. My arms were shaking by the time I flipped it over.
                  The emergency house key was still there, thank God. Sandy's
                  parents told her to never, ever tell anyone outside of her
                  family about it, but she told me. The alarm code to the house
                  was the same.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I had to stop to catch my breath halfway up the stairs to the
                  second floor. My stomach growled. I thought about raiding
                  their kitchen for food. For a moment, the face of the janitor
                  was all I could see. My body dry heaved. When I got myself
                  back under control, I climbed the rest of the way to Sandy's
                  room.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Lorry was right. Dried blood covered everything. The worst of
                  it was a huge patch staining the carpet beside the bed, but
                  there were splatters on the walls and even the ceiling.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Small, bloody handprints made a trail across the floor and
                  along the wall, ending in a large patch of blood. They were
                  the size of Sandy's hands, so they had to be hers. There was
                  one much larger handprint on the wall. It could have been a
                  man's hand, except each fingertip was pointed like a claw. I
                  looked away so I wouldn't be sick again.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I tried to find Sandy's diary. We started writing them
                  together when we were little, and I know she kept up with it
                  too. It wasn't anywhere in her room. The police probably took
                  it as evidence. Luckily, they didn't find her secret
                  compartment. I'm the only person Sandy ever told about it. She
                  taped a piece of cardboard under her dresser to make a hidden
                  shelf.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The first thing I pulled out was a picture of me. It was a 5x8
                  from photo day in middle school. Sandy had crossed out my
                  eyes. She wrote a message on the bottom. &quot;I thought you
                  were my friend.&quot;
                </p>

                <p>
                  The only other thing in the compartment was a piece of lined
                  notebook paper covered in sketches. A large image of a head
                  covered the center of the page, with smaller versions
                  scattered around it. All were drawings of the janitor.
                </p>

                <p><strong>8/23 Sun</strong></p>

                <p>
                  Dad carried me downstairs to the dining room table. I tried to
                  fight back, but I'm so weak now that I couldn't do anything.
                  They stood on the other side of the table and watched me. They
                  wouldn't leave until I finished my whole plate of food.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I was crying and trying to fight them, but I was so hungry
                  too.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As soon as the first piece of asparagus touched my lips, I
                  could feel him behind me. I glanced back through the windows.
                  He was standing in the middle of the front yard, smiling and
                  drooling.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I ate the rest of the plate. I didn't look back, even though I
                  knew he took a step with every bite.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Mom and Dad looked even worse by the time I finished. I was
                  crying and shaking. They just don't know. They can't see him.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Dad helped me out of the chair so he could take me back to my
                  bedroom. I tried not to look, but I couldn't stop myself. The
                  janitor was standing in our living room.
                </p>

                <p>He's going to get me. Oh god he's going to get me.</p>

                <p><strong>8/24 Mon</strong></p>

                <p>
                  Amanda and Cici sat with me in the courtyard during lunch.
                  They think it will make them look compassionate to take pity
                  on me. They were both gorging themselves on food--so much
                  food! They talked with their mouths full, not even bothering
                  to be courteous.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Disgusting. It was like watching a bunch of pigs wallow in
                  filth. Amanda turned to me, gave me a fake smile, and asked if
                  I wanted a bite of her ham sandwich. I screamed at her.
                  &quot;Why are you so fat?&quot;
                </p>

                <p>
                  I don't know why I said that. It wasn't what I meant to
                  say...it just came out. Immediately after I said it, I felt
                  the grossness pour over me again, even though I hadn't eaten
                  any food. Nausea. My skin felt like it was trying to crawl off
                  of my body.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Amanda shuddered. She stared wide-eyed at me for a few seconds
                  before regaining her composure. Then she stood up and grabbed
                  Cici's arm. The walked away from me.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement from across the
                  courtyard. When I turned my head, I saw him. He was standing
                  very far away, on the other side of the lawn by the gym doors.
                  He wasn't looking at me. His head moved slowly, and I followed
                  his gaze. He was watching Amanda.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I'm so sorry, Amanda. I passed this curse to you just like
                  Sandy gave it to me. I shouldn't have let it get this far.
                </p>

                <p><strong>8/25 Tue</strong></p>

                <p>
                  I couldn't sleep last night. School was a blur. I avoided
                  Amanda and Cici, and I'm sure they don't want to talk to me
                  anyway.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Mom and Dad didn't try to make me eat again. After I went
                  upstairs, I waited and listened to them. They were whispering,
                  but they weren't being quiet enough. They're going to put me
                  in the hospital and jab an IV in my arm.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I can't take this hunger anymore. I have no other options.
                  I've thought about slitting my wrists or even using Dad's
                  pistol, but everyone would think it's a suicide. I don't want
                  people to think I killed myself.
                </p>

                <p>
                  After Mom and Dad went to bed, I snuck down to the kitchen and
                  got a bowl of peanuts. I'm sitting on the bed now with them in
                  front of me. My phone is tucked away on my bookshelf, and it's
                  recording. The police will go through my things and find the
                  video. They might not be able to see the monster, but they
                  will see what he's going to do to me.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I ate a peanut. I can feel him. He's just outside of the door.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Oh fuck! I ate another peanut, and he was just suddenly in my
                  room. He didn't float through the door or anything. He was
                  outside one second, and when I swallowed he was just...there.
                </p>

                <p>
                  He looks different now that he's close. His skin is thin. I
                  can see the black veins underneath, and he's covered in
                  swollen lumps like angry pimples. His skin moves on its own,
                  almost like a sheet flapping in the wind.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I always thought he was wearing a one-piece uniform. It's not.
                  It's a suit made of skin. There are patches of hair in a few
                  places, from different people. I can tell because the hairs
                  are different colors. I guess once he kills me, he's going to
                  use my skin for part of his outfit.
                </p>

                <p>
                  His face is horrible. I can't tell what color his eyes are
                  because they're clouded over. The skin under his eyes sags
                  down onto his cheeks, and I can see bone under there. His
                  teeth are huge and flat, like a horse.
                </p>

                <p>I'm shaking. I can barely write anymore.</p>

                <p>
                  It's time. I just want to get it over with. I'm going to put
                  this diary on the top shelf in the closet so my blood won't
                  make it illegible.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I love you Mom. I love you Dad. I just want you to know this
                  wasn't your fault. There wasn't anything you could do to help.
                  This is a monster. A real monster.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Three more peanuts. Three more steps. It will finally be over.
