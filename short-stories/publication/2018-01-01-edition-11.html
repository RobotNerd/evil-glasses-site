                  Nick stood at his workbench and ran his hand over the
                  glasswood board looking for catches that needed to be sanded.
                  After he was done he wiped the board down with a damp cloth
                  revealing its foggy grey and clear layers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She always wanted him to make a glasswood chest of drawers for
                  her.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Uncle Nick!” His five-year-old nephew, Ashton, squeezed
                  through the slim opening. He was followed by Nick's older
                  sister, Jen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nick looked at his sister and nephew. There was something else
                  Nick would never be able to give her. Something she wanted
                  above all else.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Mom told me to tell you dinner is done so you can come and
                  eat with us!” Ashton said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jen smiled at Ashton's enthusiasm. “Dinner is ready,” she
                  repeated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nick wet his cloth and went back to wiping down the glasswood.
                  “I'll eat later.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ashton hugged Nick's side for a split second. “Okay. I wish
                  you would eat with us, though.”
                </p>
                <p>“Go inside,” Nick said.</p>
                <p>
                  Jen groaned at her brother. He looked at her and she shook her
                  head as she and Ashton left the barn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nick stared at the glasswood board in his hand, unable to tear
                  his eyes away from it. He held it so tight his fingers ached.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  She opened the door as wide as she could and slid through the
                  thin opening. Heavy, broken machinery blocked the door and
                  prevented it from being opened wide.
                </p>
                <p>“Are you ready to eat?” she asked.</p>
                <p>
                  He slid two pieces of redwood together creating an almost
                  seamless joint. “Uh, I'll eat in a bit.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Okay. It'll be in the fridge then.” She knew how he was. A
                  bit meant hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Thank you.” He didn't look at her but his voice was polite
                  and caring.
                </p>
                <p>“Everything okay?” she asked.</p>
                <p>
                  “Yeah.” He still looked down at his work. “Just about set on
                  this corner.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  She watched his back and his strong arms and his bent-over
                  head.
                </p>
                <p>“See you inside,” she said.</p>
                <p>“Thanks, babe.”</p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  He should have gone in to eat with her, he should have danced
                  with her in the living room after, he should have taken her in
                  his arms and walked them upstairs to make love.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nick didn't go into the house until just after eleven at
                  night. He opened the fridge and saw the plate his sister had
                  prepared for him. Instead, he grabbed an apple and ate it on
                  the way to his bedroom that was upstairs. He threw the core in
                  his small trash can, took off his shirt, and fell onto his
                  bed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He woke up around four in the morning. He went downstairs and
                  started coffee, got out the plate of food from the day before
                  and put it all in a pan to heat on the stove.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Uncle Nick,” his nephew said in a sleepy voice. Nick turned
                  to the sound, surprised that he wasn't the only one awake.
                </p>
                <p>“What are you doing?” Nick asked.</p>
                <p>Ashton rubbed his eyes and swayed a bit.</p>
                <p>“I'm thirsty.”</p>
                <p>
                  “Okay.” Nick looked around the kitchen for a glass. “What can
                  you drink? Milk or something?”
                </p>
                <p>“I don't know.”</p>
                <p>“Well, what do you want?”</p>
                <p>“Water.”</p>
                <p>
                  Nick held a glass under the tap and then handed it to Ashton.
                  He drank it but spilled about a quarter of it on himself and
                  the floor.
                </p>
                <p>“Go back to bed now.”</p>
                <p>Ashton rubbed his eyes again. “Can you come with me?”</p>
                <p>
                  “To your room? No. It's right down there. You know where it
                  is.”
                </p>
                <p>“Okay.”</p>
                <p>
                  Once Ashton was out of the kitchen his food was a bit crispy
                  on one side and lukewarm on the other. He ate it out of the
                  pan and put it in the sink when he was done. He headed to the
                  barn before the sun came out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He cut another piece of glasswood and held it up to the bright
                  overhead light. The fog grey twisted in the clear glass.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  “I'd love one made out of glasswood,” she held a pine drawer
                  in her hands while he was working on the corner details.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “That stuff is hard to get right. And painful to cut down.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Well,” she put it down on the workbench, “good thing you're
                  the best.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  He looked at her. She smiled. “Do you think you can take a
                  break or something?” She bit her lip.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He dropped his tool and quickly gathered her in his arms.
                  “Yes.”
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  Nick was in the house by nine that night. Jen walked into the
                  kitchen and was surprised to see him.
                </p>
                <p>“Jesus, Nick. You scared me.”</p>
                <p>He didn't say anything.</p>
                <p>
                  She got herself together and sat at the table. “Ashton wants
                  to hang out with you tomorrow in the shop.”
                </p>
                <p>“No.”</p>
                <p>
                  “Come on. Since we've been here you've probably spent no more
                  than 24 hours with him.”
                </p>
                <p>“I don't want to watch him.”</p>
                <p>
                  “He's a good kid. If you tell him not to get in the way or
                  touch something he won't.”
                </p>
                <p>“No.”</p>
                <p>“What if I watch him while we're all in the shop?”</p>
                <p>“I don't want to hang around a baby.”</p>
                <p>“He's your nephew and he's not a baby.”</p>
                <p>Nick pointed his finger at his sister. “No.”</p>
                <p>
                  She rolled her eyes. “Fine. But maybe a dinner once in awhile
                  would be a good compromise. I'm sick of making some bullshit
                  excuse about why he can't see someone he loves so much.”
                </p>
                <p>“I haven't done anything for him to love me.”</p>
                <p>“I know.” She got up and left the kitchen.</p>
                <p>Nick heard Ashton call for her from down the hall.</p>
                <br />
                <p align="center">***</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  She had stopped going to the doctor to hear the same thing
                  over and over again. Brain tumor, four months to live, this
                  type of thing rarely happens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He stared at her while she slept. He was always terrified that
                  it would be her last night. He ran his hand along her thinning
                  arm. The thought of him not being there when she passed
                  consumed his thoughts. Having her be alone in her last
                  conscious seconds was his own nightmare. His throat felt iced
                  and he struggled to keep his tears from falling.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  Nick ran his hand over the top of the hollow chest of drawers.
                  The design of the piece was all based on things he had to
                  remember she said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “<i
                    >The wood is so beautiful, there's no need for
                    embellishment.”</i
                  >
                </p>
                <p>The lines were straight, the corners smooth.</p>
                <p>“<i>Three drawers are too small.”</i></p>
                <p>The even sides, three and three, all the same size.</p>
                <p>“<i>I love you.”</i></p>
                <p>I miss you.</p>
                <p>
                  “Uncle Nick.” Ashton was standing almost by his side. “What
                  are you doing?”
                </p>
                <p>Nick stared at Ashton.</p>
                <p>
                  “<i
                    >I think my second biggest regret is that we didn't have a
                    baby. My first is leaving you so soon.”</i
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  If they had a baby he would have had a piece of her forever.
                </p>
                <p>“What are you doing?” Nick asked.</p>
                <p>“Mom said I could come watch you.”</p>
                <p>Nick grumbled and picked up a completed glasswood drawer.</p>
                <p>
                  “Where did you get these?” Ashton asked of the wood furniture.
                </p>
                <p>“I made them.”</p>
                <p>
                  “Wow.” Ashton struggled to climb on a chair that was too high
                  for him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nick helped him up by quickly grabbing him under the arms and
                  placing him squarely on the seat. “Stay there,” Nick said.
                </p>
                <p>“Is this your job, Uncle Nick?”</p>
                <p>“It was.”</p>
                <p>Nick slid the drawer in the bottom left slot.</p>
                <p>“What are you doing?”</p>
                <p>“Making a chest of drawers.”</p>
                <p>“What's it made of?”</p>
                <p>“Glasswood.”</p>
                <p>“I've never heard of that.”</p>
                <p>
                  “<i
                    >I would have liked to have a son so that he could have been
                    just like you.”</i
                  >
                </p>
                <p>But he didn't want anything to be like him.</p>
                <p>
                  “It's very rare but we live close to a small clearing of
                  glasswood trees.”
                </p>
                <p>“Can we go there?”</p>
                <p>“Maybe.”</p>
                <p>Ashton kicked his feet.</p>
                <p>“Can we maybe go now?”</p>
                <p>
                  “If you want to be here with me in the shop you can't talk
                  this much.”
                </p>
                <p>“Okay.”</p>
                <p>
                  Ashton was quiet but he still kicked his feet. He played with
                  his hands and hummed to himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nick watched his nephew from the corner of his eye. He was a
                  good kid.
                </p>
                <p>“Come here,” Nick said.</p>
                <p>
                  Ashton slid off the chair and went to Nick's side. “Can I
                  help?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nick looked through the clear glasswood. “Bring me that drawer
                  over there.”

                  You float in the black soup. You have no body, only your eyes,
                  your consciousness, suspended on the metaphysical plane. Small
                  dots of glowing light surround you in all directions,
                  millions, billions, too many to imagine. You feel the weight
                  of them and it makes you claustrophobic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your thoughts are hazy, and you struggle to focus. You can't
                  remember who you are or how you came to be. There is no past,
                  future, or present. There just is. After an instant and an
                  eternity, you <i>move</i>. Your consciousness brushes against
                  the closest points of light—

                    Today is our 50th anniversary, and we celebrate in the place
                    where we had our first date. I smile at her as I take a bite
                    out of my toast, and that's when my heart stops beating. I
                    fall face-first onto my plate, unable to move. I hear my
                    wife screaming in the last few seconds before I lose
                    consciousness.</i

                    jump as high as I can, but the stupid ball flies by just out
                    of reach. I run into the street to get it. I only see the

                  You spiral back into the black soup, your mind reeling from
                  the intensity of the visions. You were those people. Are those
                  people. Will be. Their pain is your pain, and their deaths cut
                  razor sharp into your soul. You don't want to move again.

                  You have no way to measure the passage of time. Nothing exists
                  except the lights. You grow weary of staring at them. The lack
                  of stimulation is painful.

                    maintenance technician repairing a radio tower. The wind
                    picked up unexpectedly in the last few minutes, and the
                    tower is swaying. I've never been afraid on the job until
                    today. I call it early and start my descent. I'm going
                    faster than I should, not being careful, and I don't secure
                    my harness. A heavy gust of wind throws me off balance, I

                    off a big score while we were doing an 8-ball one night, and
                    Thomas made it happen. I hear yelling from the alleyway
                    behind me, where Thomas went to meet the dealers. I pull the
                    .38 out of my jacket pocket and run towards the noise. I
                    round a corner and all I see is a gun barrel pointed at my
                    face. The shot is loud and brief.</i

                    of my children and grandchildren. I try to speak, to tell
                    them it is ok, but all my cancerous body can manage is a
                    croak. Tamil, my eldest, places his warm, strong hand over

                    yelling to each other, tightening the noose, trying to
                    surround me. They believe I betrayed them to the government

                    other than being a guerrilla fighter in a hopeless war.
                    Mugabe is suddenly in front of me, appearing out of the

                    cannot pull the trigger. I've known him all my life, and I

                    In the brief second that I turn to look back at him, a car
