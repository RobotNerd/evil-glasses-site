                  Concerts. Michelle and I loved going to them. The swaying of
                  human bodies jammed together trying to get as close as
                  possible to the stage, everyone hoping to capture some of the
                  magic made by the musicians. Michelle and I were always there,
                  side-by-side, our sweat and breath mingling with the rest of
                  the people around us. The music itself didn't matter: country,
                  rock, pop, metal. It was about the people around us and the
                  energy we all created together.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before each show, she would look up to me with her big blue
                  eyes and say, "Promise that you won't leave my side."
                </p>
                <p>
                  And I would say, "I swear. I'll never let you go." Then I
                  would kiss her forehead.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Michelle was funny, pretty, and she laughed at my jokes, but
                  she wasn't perfect. She had it rough growing up. Her father
                  wasn't around, and her mother was the queen of verbal abuse.
                  Michelle started using alcohol to cope when she was in high
                  school, and she was twenty when she had her first DUI. By the
                  time we met she was sober, mostly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She fell off the wagon four days before she disappeared. It
                  was a Wednesday, and I came home from work to find the front
                  door of our rental house unlocked and cracked open. A trail of
                  clothes led from the foyer to the bedroom, where I found her
                  naked and passed out on top of the covers. An empty bottle of
                  vodka sat on the bedside table.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When she woke I hugged her and she started crying. "My mom
                  called me today."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Are you ok?" I said, gritting my teeth. Michelle's mother was
                  a worthless old witch.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "She asked me for money," Michelle said. "But I told her I
                  wasn't going to give it to her anymore." She leaned into me
                  and I could feel her tears on my neck. "She said she should
                  have gotten rid of me before I was born."
                </p>
                <p>
                  I held her like that for a long time, gently rubbing her hair.
                  Her tears dried up, and she leaned back and looked into my
                  eyes. "I'm so, so sorry, Mike. I needed a drink and I couldn't
                  fight it. Do you hate me?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Shh," I said and pulled her closer. "I love you. I'm not
                  going anywhere."
                </p>
                <p>
                  I took off the rest of the week from work to spend time with
                  her. By Saturday, she was smiling brightly like she normally
                  did. "Are you sure you still want to go?" I said. We had
                  tickets to see Blink 182 that night.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Yeah," she said. She hugged me tight around my waist and
                  pressed her head to my chest. "Thank you," she said softly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The concert was in an old warehouse that had been converted
                  into a music hall and bar. Michelle and I got there an hour
                  early, and we posted up right in front of the stage, waiting
                  for the show to begin. Something in the air made me a little
                  uneasy, but I couldn't place it. Michelle sensed my mood. "You
                  okay?" she said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I don't know," I said, looking around the room. "Something
                  doesn't feel right."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Hey," Michelle said, smiling at me with her sparkling eyes.
                  "Promise you won't leave my side."
                </p>
                <p>
                  I smiled and kissed her forehead. "I'll never let you go."
                </p>
                <p>
                  The room filled up while the opening act played, and it was
                  packed by the time Blink took the stage. My discomfort only
                  grew worse, and I felt the odd detachment from reality that
                  only comes from dreams. The air turned thick and heavy, like I
                  was swimming in mud. The people around us pressed in too
                  close, and the music was wrong. Every song was in a minor key.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I kept watching Michelle out of the corner of my eye. She was
                  singing and dancing as always. My impulse was to drag her
                  outside to where it was quiet and safe, but I didn't. I was
                  just being crazy, and I didn't want to ruin her night. I held
                  onto her hand tightly, keeping her close to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then Blink launched into the signature guitar riff of their
                  song "What's My Age Again?" The crowd went insane, their
                  screams louder than at any other time so far that night. Then
                  time seemed to slow down. The music and voices blurred
                  together and faded like they were far away. The bright lights
                  of the stage were gone, and the ceiling was shrouded in
                  darkness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Something slammed into me from behind. I stumbled forward
                  against the sweaty back of a guy in front of me, and I fell
                  down on one knee. My arm was twisted back behind me at a weird
                  angle because I wouldn't let go of Michelle. Somewhere deep
                  down I knew that I had to hold on to her.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Michelle yanked my arm and I felt a sharp pain in my shoulder.
                  I almost lost my grip, and she squeezed so hard I thought my
                  fingers would break. I turned to look at her, but I couldn't
                  understand what I saw. In my face was the chest and shoulders
                  of a man's torso, dressed in a pale blue tank top. His neck
                  extended out, and instead of a face, it was fused into the hip
                  joint of someone else.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was surrounded by a clump of body parts that melted together
                  like candle wax. A leg connected to a chest at the knee. A
                  shoulder turned into a hip, and the skin color smoothly faded
                  from one part to the next. Portions of clothing were mixed
                  into the mass, fused to each other in the same random way as
                  the bodies. Nowhere in the mix could I see a face.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Mike! Help me!" Michelle screamed. The jumble of bodies
                  between us blocked my view. Her hand was slipping out of mine,
                  and something was pulling her away.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I'm coming!" I said. I punched with my free hand, hitting any
                  and every thing. I rammed my shoulder at the torso in my way.
                  Its skin and muscle absorbed my blows like firm pillows, but
                  it didn't move. I placed my foot on a hairy knee growing out
                  of a neck and craned up to look over.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Michelle was on the other side, desperately clinging to my
                  hand. The mass of bodies behind her bent together to form some
                  kind of tunnel close to the ground. One of Michelle's legs
                  stretched back into that hole, like something had her, but it
                  was too dark down there to see.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Michelle looked up and our eyes met. Tears ran down her
                  cheeks. "Don't let me go."
                </p>
                <p>
                  A slender, gray tentacle emerged from the darkness of the
                  tunnel. It snaked up around Michelle's waist. She looked down
                  when she felt it wrapping around her and screamed. I pulled on
                  her hand with all my strength, but it was pointless. In one
                  swift motion, the tentacle yanked Michelle away and down in
                  the darkness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "No!" I yelled. I crawled over the bodies toward the hole,
                  punching the flesh in my path. In my haste, I put my foot in
                  the wrong spot and slipped, falling face first into the floor.
                  I blacked out for just a moment, and when I opened my eyes
                  four guys were holding me down on the floor. One of them had a
                  bloody nose.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Get off of me," I yelled. I struggled against them, but I
                  couldn't move. They held me down until two huge bouncers
                  arrived, and I was hauled kicking and screaming into the alley
                  behind the building. "You have to let me back in," I said.
                  "Something took my girlfriend."
                </p>
                <p>
                  The cops showed up and I tried to tell them what happened, but
                  of course they didn't believe me. Who would? They figured I
                  got drugged out of my mind, started attacking people at the
                  concert, and that Michelle must have ditched me. They locked
                  me up for the night. I wanted to believe them. What I saw
                  wasn't possible. I convinced myself that the cops were right,
                  and I held onto the thought that it was all just a bad dream.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I got out the next day and took a bus home, but Michelle
                  wasn't there. All of my calls went to her voicemail, and she
                  didn't answer any of my texts. I went back to the police
                  station and tried to file a missing person's report, but they
                  just threatened to lock me back up again. I grew more
                  desperate with each passing day. When the cops finally
                  realized that Michelle was actually missing, they pegged me as
                  the main suspect. But with no evidence and no leads, they
                  finally gave up and quit looking.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most important person in my world was gone. I quit showing
                  up to work and eventually got my termination notice in the
                  mail. My days were spent in the apartment staring at the empty
                  places where Michelle should have been. Her head resting on
                  the pillow on her side of the bed. Michelle standing in my way
                  in front of the sink when we were both trying to get ready in
                  the morning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One day I got a good look at myself in the mirror. I had not
                  shaved in weeks, and I couldn't remember the last time I
                  showered. Michelle would have been disappointed in the sad
                  sack that I became. Then I felt a burning anger rising up from
                  my gut. Something took her from me, some monster killed her. I
                  made a promise to myself that I would find out what it was,
                  and I would kill it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For two years I combed through every missing persons report I
                  could find, looking for anything remotely similar to what
                  happened to her. The details were always sketchy, and I had to
                  do a lot of reading between the lines. I believed the key was
                  to focus on cases of people who suddenly disappeared in
                  crowded, public spaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I emailed a woman in Seattle who lost her boyfriend during an
                  environmental protest. He was a former heroin addict who was
                  working hard to get clean. They were standing together on the
                  street holding signs. She looked away for a moment, and he was
                  gone when she turned around. She never saw him again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There were others. A guy in Kentucky lost his brother while
                  they were at the track, betting on the races. A man's teenage
                  son disappeared from beside him in the stands at a college
                  football game. A woman's mother vanished at a country music
                  concert. A man's husband was taken from him in Times Square on
                  New Year's Eve.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All of the victims were addicts at one point, but they had
                  beaten their habits. In the days right before they
                  disappeared, each one of them had relapsed. It always happened
                  in a public place with plenty of potential witnesses who never
                  saw anything. With that theory, I came up with a plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I volunteered at a rehab facility, and that's where I met
                  Chelsea. She was a recovering meth addict, emotionally
                  vulnerable, and in desperate need of a boyfriend. She slept
                  with me the same night we met, and we started dating right
                  away. She was the perfect bait.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She relapsed in the second month we were dating. I found her
                  at the apartment of one of her trashy friends. She was tweaked
                  out of her mind. Chelsea fought against me, but I hauled her
                  out of there and told her it was for her own good. I locked
                  her in my bedroom for two days.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She actually thanked me when I let her out. I felt a pang of
                  guilt, but I brushed it aside. Chelsea was my key to finding
                  out what happened to Michelle. As a "reward" for her being so
                  strong, I bought tickets to an EDM concert that weekend. She
                  was really into that kind of crap.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On that Friday night, we stood in a crowd of people jammed
                  close together near the stage. They were scantily clad,
                  sweaty, and dancing with the rhythm of deep base coming from
                  the speakers. I held onto Chelsea's hand tightly, and she
                  looked at me and smiled. She yelled something to me over the
                  music. I think it was, "I love you."
                </p>
                <p>
                  It happened when the main act, Vorpal Geyser, came on stage.
                  The crowd went wild, and everything started moving in slow
                  motion. I looked around and saw that I was no longer
                  surrounded by people. They had been replaced by the mass of
                  body parts melted together. I still held Chelsea's hand, but
                  she was being pulled away. I dropped to my knees, rammed my
                  shoulders into the creature, and crawled across the concrete
                  floor following Chelsea as she was pulled away.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My hand touched something soft. It was a bicep, and at the
                  crook of the elbow it connected to an ankle. I was in a tunnel
                  made of disjointed body parts of the creature. It was dark,
                  and I could barely see Chelsea's face even though I still held
                  her hand. She screamed for help, but her voice sounded so far
                  away.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What was I doing? This was madness. I should have never
                  allowed myself to go this far, using another human being as
                  bait. Even though I couldn't see them, I knew there were
                  tentacles wrapped around Chelsea. I tried to pull her back
                  anyway, but just like with Michelle, she was snatched out of
                  my grasp.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I followed, scrambling down the tunnel until it ended in a
                  steep drop at the edge of a giant cavern. The walls stretched
                  away into the distance, every surface made of writhing human
                  parts. A pale mist hung in the air below, obscuring the
                  ground. The stalk of a giant gray mushroom rose out of the
                  mist. It was as thick and as tall as a skyscraper, and its
                  surface was covered in small twitching white specks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Chelsea was carried through the air by a long tentacle that
                  grew directly out of the mushroom stalk. She was beyond my
                  help now, and I could only listen to her faint screams. The
                  tentacle pulled her into the main body of the mushroom
                  creature. She kicked and slapped the surface, but her hands
                  and feet stuck to it like hot tar.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The mushroom skin oozed over Chelsea, absorbing her until only
                  her face remained. Her skin slowly turned to the same gray
                  color as the mushroom stalk, and only her eyes remained. Oh
                  god, those eyes. All of the tiny, flitting specks covering the
                  creature were human eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then out of the thousands covering the monster, I was drawn to
                  one pair of deep blue eyes. Michelle. She saw me, and I could
                  sense that she recognized me. In that moment I felt her pain
                  and fear, and the weight of the lost life that we would never
                  share. She was trapped in eternal torment with no hope of
                  redemption. I screamed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Her eyes looked at me with a sense of urgency. She wanted me
                  to go, to get away from this hellish place and back to safety.
                  I looked at her one last time and mouthed the words, "I love
                  you." Then I turned away like a coward and crawled out. The
                  tunnel shrank as I went, the walls closing in and threatening
                  to crush me. I wormed my way out through the last few feet,
                  the exit by then barely wider than my shoulders.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I fell out onto the concrete floor back in the real world, my
                  empty heart beating from the exertion. Vorpal Geyser launched
                  into another song. I knelt there on the floor and cried. It
                  would have been better if Michelle was dead. I wished I was
                  dead. Someone eventually grabbed my arm and guided me out of
                  the crowd.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I tore my rotator cuff holding onto Chelsea, although I didn't
                  feel it at the time. The doctor gave me a prescription for
                  Vicodin to help with the pain, and it was easy to keep taking
                  it even after I was physically recovered. I wanted it to help
                  me forget, to take away the emotional pain. It took me a year
                  to quit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I should feel guilty for what I did to Chelsea—and I do, a
                  little—but mostly my thoughts are consumed with Michelle. I
                  can't stop seeing her tormented eyes, my beautiful girlfriend
                  absorbed as part of that creature. I promised I would never
                  leave her side.
                </p>

                  Mary is a single mother of two, and she's never broken a rule
                  in her life. We met online and started dating not long after.
                  Earlier this week, I intentionally relapsed using the bottle
                  of Vicodin I had secretly stashed away. Mary took off work and
                  stayed with me for a couple of days to make sure I got clean.

                  He found her sitting on the couch in the dark. “What are you
                  doing awake?”
                </p>
                <p>“I couldn't sleep. Do you want to sit with me?”</p>
                <p>
                  “No.” He didn't find the couch comfortable but she liked it.
                  "I want to lie down.”
                </p>
                <p>“Okay. Well, I'll be here.”</p>
                <p>
                  “You'll be here all night?” He leaned against the wall, rubbed
                  his eyes, and yawned.
                </p>
                <p>“Probably. I'm not tired anymore.”</p>
                <p>“It's only been four hours.”</p>
                <p>“I napped earlier. I'm fine,” she said.</p>
                <p>
                  “Were you playing music or singing or something?” he asked.
                </p>
                <p>She shook her head.</p>
                <p>“Okay. I'm going back to bed.”</p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  He lay there in bed, tightly holding his eyes closed. He was
                  so tired. He thought he heard humming every night. It was a
                  nonsensical song that he heard when he closed his eyes but
                  couldn't hear when he listened for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His alarm went off. He wanted to yell into his pillow but
                  instead lay there motionless hoping that the clock was wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She leaned in the room holding onto the doorway. “I can make
                  breakfast. How about that?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  He rubbed his eyes and turned off his alarm. “Sure, sure that
                  sounds great. Coffee?”
                </p>
                <p>“It's ready. Want me to pour you a cup?”</p>
                <p>
                  He nodded as he got out of bed. She stayed in the doorway and
                  they kissed when he walked by.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Do you feel okay?” he asked, walking to the dining area of
                  the living room.
                </p>
                <p>“Yes.” She smiled.</p>
                <p>“I'm worried about you being up all the time.”</p>
                <p>“I'm fine.”</p>
                <p>“Then I just miss you in bed.” He smiled.</p>
                <p>She smiled.</p>
                <p>
                  He sat at the two-person table under the window and opened his
                  laptop to check the news.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She walked through to the kitchen to start breakfast. He heard
                  her humming. He slammed his laptop closed as he realized that
                  it was her humming keeping him up at night.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He rushed to the kitchen and stared at her. “You hum that at
                  night.”
                </p>
                <p>“You can hear me?”</p>
                <p>
                  “Yes. I didn't think it was you. I thought I was dreaming it
                  or that it was the neighbors.”
                </p>
                <p>She frowned. “I'm sorry.”</p>
                <p>
                  A fear of losing another night of sleep flared in him and he
                  heard the humming in his mind. He needed her to sleep, or for
                  her to leave, or he needed to get out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But all he could say was, “I don't want to wake up without
                  you.”
                </p>
                <p>“I'll try,” she said.</p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  He snapped awake in the dark. She wasn't next to him. He heard
                  her in the living room, pacing and humming. He got up and went
                  to her. She turned to him and smiled.
                </p>
                <p>“Hi,” she said.</p>
                <p>“Why can't you sleep?”</p>
                <p>
                  She stared wide-eyed and shook her head. His shoulders fell
                  and he went to her, hugged her. He leaned his head on her
                  head.
                </p>
                <p>“What's wrong with you?” he asked.</p>
                <p>“I feel fine.”</p>
                <p>
                  “Just because you feel fine doesn't mean that you are,” he
                  said. “What is happening?”
                </p>
                <p>She shook her head.</p>
                <p>
                  He sighed. “Come back to bed, yeah?” He rubbed his hands
                  slowly up and down her back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She nodded and he led her by the hand. They lay down, holding
                  hands. His eyes closed only for a few moments before he heard
                  the humming. He looked at her. She was quiet. She looked
                  peaceful. He stayed awake watching her, waiting for her to
                  begin humming.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She was out of bed again when he woke. He didn't know when he
                  fell back asleep. She was sitting at the table, wrapped in a
                  blanket looking out the window.
                </p>
                <p>“Is it raining?” he asked.</p>
                <p>“Yes. Good morning. Was I making noise?”</p>
                <p>“Could have just been the rain.”</p>
                <p>He sat down with her.</p>
                <p>“How long have you been doing this?” he asked.</p>
                <p>
                  “I don't know,” she said. “I haven't lived with anyone for a
                  long time.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I worry about it. And you. I can't sleep and I feel like
                  shit. You have to be feeling the same.”
                </p>
                <p>“I feel fine,” she said.</p>
                <p>He shook his head. “I don't believe that.”</p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  It had been three weeks since he had a full night's rest. Now
                  his anger got in the way of caring and he let her hum and
                  pace, all night, every night by herself. Nothing he said or
                  suggested changed her behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every night he thought about leaving. Get up and go, leave
                  her.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He thought about how he needed to break up with her. The
                  reason was obvious to him. He knew she would cry. That would
                  hurt him. But there was nothing else he was willing to do for
                  her.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  “I'm sorry,” she said as they were sitting on the couch after
                  dinner. His eyes were wide, staring at the TV.
                </p>
                <p>“Why?”</p>
                <p>“You're not sleeping because of me.”</p>
                <p>He didn't respond.</p>
                <p>“I'm sorry.”</p>
                <p>He didn't respond.</p>
                <p>“Maybe I'll go stay at a hotel for a bit,” she said.</p>
                <p>He sighed. “It's your apartment. I'll go.”</p>
                <p>“I'm sorry,” she said.</p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  It had been two weeks after his hotel stay and gradually she
                  was able to stay quiet most of the night. He didn't know why
                  or care how she was able to do it. Now he didn't lie down at
                  night worrying about not being able to sleep. She still rose
                  early but didn't disturb him enough to wake him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Morning.” He joined her in the kitchen and kissed her neck.
                </p>
                <p>“Morning.”</p>
                <p>“Did you sleep well?”</p>
                <p>She nodded.</p>
                <p>“Good. Me too.”</p>
                <p>She fumbled putting the coffee pot back in the maker.</p>
                <p>“You okay?” he asked grabbing her hand.</p>
                <p>
                  “I went to the doctor while you were gone,” she said. “She
                  gave me medication to help me sleep and control the humming.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I knew there was a reason why. That's great.” He pulled her
                  into himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “My brain is also deteriorating as if I'm in the early stages
                  of dementia.”
                </p>
                <p>His grip on her didn't change.</p>
                <p>“What does that mean?” he asked.</p>
                <p>“I think I'm going to die.”</p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  Now he stayed up most nights watching her sleep, making sure
                  she was breathing. He couldn't sleep for the thought of her
                  dying, lying next to him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While he watched her he thought about the first night he'd be
                  able to sleep as much as he wanted. The night that she
                  wouldn't be there, he'd be able to sleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He knew he should be sad but he wasn't. As the nights went on
                  he turned impatient.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  She died about a month later. He met her mom and dad while he
                  moved his things. They gathered small possessions. Whatever
                  they needed to remember her by.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Her mom offered a framed picture of her for him to take as a
                  keepsake. He refused it. He didn't need it. He had memories,
                  enough of them, he told her mom when her face turned sour.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He left, drove to his new apartment and unpacked. There was no
                  bed yet but he knew he could sleep.
                </p>
