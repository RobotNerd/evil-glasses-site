                  Write a stupid joke. Be funny. Say something clever. At least
                  make fun of someone for fuck's sake. No? Why the hell not?
                  Just make fun of that girl's leggings. They are ugly. Say
                  something like “I hope she didn't pay for those.” I know it
                  isn't funny. Jesus Christ. But it's something. Get over
                  yourself and say something.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  I hadn't had a contract come through for weeks. I was doing
                  busy work. Organizing files, looking at new document
                  management software, standardizing clauses, or wasting the
                  Wi-Fi by watching Netflix and YouTube.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I hadn't been to a comedy club in months. After I got some
                  laughs with the few okay jokes I wrote, I ran dry. I watched
                  every comedy special I could but hated most of them.
                </p>
                <p>I think I'm over comedy. I don't think I like it anymore.</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Colleen carried two clear drinks back to the table we were
                  sitting at.
                </p>
                <p>“Happy hour is over in 30 minutes,” she said.</p>
                <p>
                  “Shit,” I got up once she put her drinks down. “I'll get two
                  more.”
                </p>
                <p>“This one is for you.” She was confused.</p>
                <p>
                  “Ah,” I brushed away her words, “Just in case it gets slammed
                  and we don't make it back to the bar before it's over.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was hard hanging out with people. They wanted to talk about
                  what they were doing and then ask how I was doing. I didn't
                  want to tell them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Two drinks. Drink these two drinks and you can leave. Go home,
                  sit in front of your stupid notebook and write nothing. Nice,
                  productive night. Alone.
                </p>
                <p>I got my drinks and sat back with Colleen.</p>
                <p>“Have you heard from Rhett?” she asked.</p>
                <p>
                  I hung my head. “God damn, Colleen. How about, how was my
                  weekend?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Oh, how was your weekend?” She took a sip from her drink and
                  smiled at me.
                </p>
                <p>“Shitty and boring.”</p>
                <p>“What did you do?”</p>
                <p>“Nothing. What did you do?”</p>
                <p>
                  “It's impossible to do nothing. When I was a kid my Uncle
                  would call and when I would answer he would ask 'What are you
                  doing?' I would say 'Nothing' and he would tell me, 'You can't
                  do nothing.' So I always tell him, and anyone else, what I'm
                  doing.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  She looked at me waiting for me to tell her what I did over
                  the weekend. “Jerked off and drank,” I said.
                </p>
                <p>“See, that's not nothing.”</p>
                <p>
                  I smiled reluctantly. “What did you do this weekend?” I asked
                  again.
                </p>
                <p>“I went out with that guy I had been messaging.”</p>
                <p>
                  “Oh, yeah. Was he everything his charming messages suggested?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  She pursed her lips and looked past me. “He was one of the
                  biggest jerks I have met in this city.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Her eyes glassed over with tears. I figured as much, though.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Hey, hey.” I reached over and patted her on the shoulder.
                  “There are millions of people here. There will be another.” I
                  looked around. “Like that guy!”
                </p>
                <p>
                  She looked at the chubby, balding guy with a neck beard that I
                  was pointing to. She looked back to me with a blank look on
                  her face.
                </p>
                <p>“You really aren't funny,” she told me.</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Are jokes about not being funny, funny? Are jokes about not
                  being able to make something funny, funny? Are jokes about
                  trying to be funny but not being funny, funny?
                </p>
                <p>No and they never will be.</p>
                <p>
                  Self-deprecation could be funny. I suck, I'm bad at this. I
                  haven't written a joke in months. I barely even have a handful
                  of good jokes. And that's my set, good night everyone. Thanks
                  for coming. Tip your bartender. Who doesn't tip the bartender,
                  anyway? I don't think I've ever seen anyone stiff a bartender.
                </p>
                <p>Why the fuck do people say that?</p>
                <p>
                  That's a stupid joke. Fuck the guy that got away with saying
                  that and having some stupid asshole chuckle.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  I sat at my desk clicking around on Netflix when an email from
                  Rhett came in. I didn't open it right away. I didn't want to
                  seem like I had nothing better to do than read any email I got
                  right away, no matter who it was from.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I picked a British crime drama and went to the email. I was
                  only cc'd on it. It was just an FYI about something that could
                  happen, just in case it needed a contract. Waste of my damn
                  time.
                </p>
                <p>“Steph!” Colleen leaned into my office.</p>
                <p>“Hey.”</p>
                <p>“I have a date tonight.”</p>
                <p>“See, there's a million people to date here.”</p>
                <p>
                  “I know,” she smiled and twisted her torso back and forth.
                  “You were right.”
                </p>
                <p>“Where are you guys going?”</p>
                <p>
                  “Were getting drinks at Pier 99 and then dinner somewhere if
                  it all goes well.”
                </p>
                <p>I sarcastically smiled for her. “Very cool.”</p>
                <p>
                  “Thanks.” She stayed in my office looking at my whiteboard.
                  There was only a list of music to listen to on it. “I'm going
                  to keep asking you about him. You should just tell me what
                  happened with Rhett.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Bye, Colleen. Have fun on your date. I hope you two have
                  beautiful kids.” I put my ear buds in and clicked my mouse
                  loudly and banged on my keyboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She smiled and waved as she left. I shook my head, rolled my
                  eyes, and sighed. The trifecta.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The thing that upsets me when people ask me about Rhett is
                  that I know for certain he's not anything like what I made him
                  out to be. He wasn't even the type of person everyone else
                  thought he was.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We worked it out that he would come visit for a weekend. We
                  went out, had fun, came back to my place, had sex, drank
                  coffee in the morning, and then he left early.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I messaged him too many times and got no response to most of
                  them until he stopped all together. The last message he sent
                  me was, “Don't tell anyone about us. It was a one time thing.”
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  It feels like I'm mad at him, furious that that's all he ended
                  up being, but I know I'm mad at myself. I didn't need to make
                  him what he wasn't, the perfect man and the only person on the
                  planet that could make me happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And when I think about being funny I think about that night
                  and how hopeful and happy I was and I don't want to be funny
                  anymore.
                </p>
                <p>That's what happened with Rhett.</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Colleen and I were out after work. She was talking about the
                  guy she was dating now, how great he was and how she hoped
                  he's the one.
                </p>
                <p>“How can you hope someone is the one?” I asked.</p>
                <p>“I just want him to be the one, then.”</p>
                <p>
                  “He either will be or he won't be. You can't make people be
                  the one.”
                </p>
                <p>“But we can grow into it.”</p>
                <p>
                  “Isn't that something you both are supposed to feel right off
                  the bat?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  She smiled, “Maybe we did and we just aren't telling each
                  other yet.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “You better tell him soon.” I finished my drink and looked for
                  the waiter.
                </p>
                <p>“I'm not worried about it, for once.”</p>
                <p>Her optimism was tiring.</p>
                <p>“Let's talk about something different,” I said.</p>
                <p>
                  “Okay. Did you hear the diss track Tanya la Tigre put out
                  yesterday?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  I smiled hoping this would be a good distraction. “No, sounds
                  like a fake name, and tell me everything about it.”

                <p>
                  I know I'll get over Rhett. But I don't know if I'll ever be
                  funny.

                  Ned parked his 2005 Pontiac Grand Am in a tight space in front
                  of the apartment complex. It wasn't a sweet ride, but it was
                  the best he could afford with his paycheck. Bartending was
                  supposed to pay well, but the only job Ned could land was at
                  the shittiest country-western dive in town. The only good
                  thing about the place was that he got to stare at Carmen's
                  sweet ass all day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned bent over and checked himself out in the side mirror of
                  the car. One strand of hair poked up higher than the others.
                  He licked his thumb and used it to put his hair back in place.
                  He sported a thin, scraggly goatee on his chin. His facial
                  hair wouldn't grow out as thick as he would like, but it
                  helped cover up his acne scars. Ned smiled and gave his
                  reflection a thumbs up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Carmen's apartment was on the second floor of the complex. Ned
                  bounded up the stairs and found her door. He paused to take a
                  quick sniff of his armpits. Yep, all good. He knocked and
                  waited.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The light blue door swung open. Ned felt a tingling in his
                  groin, just like he did every time he saw Carmen. Her long
                  blonde hair glowed in the light of the late afternoon sun. Her
                  tits formed perfect mounds under her t-shirt, and her tight
                  red shorts showed off her amazing legs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Ned!" she said, smiling. "Thank you so much for doing this.
                  You're a life saver."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned smiled back, but not too wide. He didn't want to come
                  across as desperate and scare her off. "Not a problem. I'm
                  glad to be of service."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Yay," Carmen said. She took a step back and waved him in with
                  her hand. "Come in. I'll give you the quick tour, and then I
                  have to run."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned followed her inside, and Carmen closed the door behind
                  him. While she had her back turned, Ned checked her out. Her
                  shorts squeezed against her perfect ass. Her long smooth legs
                  were lean from running 5k every day. Carmen turned around and
                  caught Ned looking. He didn't care.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Carmen cleared her throat, and Ned looked back at her face.
                  "So this is my place," she said. Ned looked around. The front
                  door opened into her living room. An off-white couch faced the
                  TV, a 55-inch LED that was much nicer than the crappy
                  second-hand plasma that Ned had at his place. A large book
                  titled "Kittens" sat on the glass coffee table, the front
                  cover a basket full of white furry kittens.
                </p>
                <p>"Nice," Ned said. "You should be an interior decorator."</p>
                <p>
                  "Uh huh," Carmen said. "I'll have a fallback career if finance
                  doesn't work out."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Nah, a classy chick like you? You'd make a killing working on
                  the homes of rich idiots." Decorating was good work for a
                  woman.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "So," Carmen said, "let me show you where everything is." She
                  led Ned down the short hallway at the other end of the living
                  room. Carmen pointed to the small kitchen on the left. A pair
                  of light blue dishes sat on the floor against the wall, one
                  filled with water and the other with cat food. "Fluffy only
                  eats dry food. The bag is in the last cabinet on the bottom.
                  No people food—it upsets his stomach."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "What about cake on his birthday?" Ned said. Hah, that was
                  pretty clever.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Carmen looked at him without even a hint of a smile. "No
                  people food."
                </p>
                <p>"Got it," Ned said. His smile faded.</p>
                <p>
                  "There's the bathroom," Carmen said. Ned leaned his head
                  around the doorframe to peek inside. The pink bathmat matched
                  the curtains that covered the one tiny window in the room.
                  "The litter box is in there. Just clean it out every day when
                  you come over to feed him." Ugh. That was going to be the most
                  disgusting part of this. The things Ned did for a piece of
                  ass.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The bedroom was across the hall from the bathroom. Carmen
                  walked in, and Ned followed. The room was tidy like the rest
                  of the apartment, and just as girly. A vase full of dried
                  flowers sat on the bedside table, and the walls were decorated
                  with mass-produced artwork. A large dresser stood against the
                  wall and on top sat a framed picture of Carmen and Fluffy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sitting in the middle of the queen-sized bed was a long-haired
                  black cat. A large section of his torso was covered in white
                  bandages, squashing the fur underneath. The cat looked at Ned
                  with his yellow eyes and meowed. Ned hated cats.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "And here's my little man," Carmen said in a stupid baby-talk
                  voice. She leaned over the bed and stroked Fluffy's head. The
                  cat didn't even look at her. His eyes were locked on Ned.
                  "Isn't he just the cutest thing you've ever seen?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Oh, yeah," Ned said. "He's really cute." The cat's eyes bore
                  into Ned, like he knew Ned's intentions with Carmen and didn't
                  approve. "Did you ever find out what happened to him?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  "No," Carmen said. "The vet thinks it might have been a
                  raccoon or a fox. But I'm sure Fluffy hurt it more than it
                  hurt him. Isn't that right, sweetie?" Carmen rubbed her nose
                  on the cat's face. Gross.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Meow," Fluffy said. Ned let his gaze drift around the room.
                  He lingered on the small top drawer of the dresser. She
                  probably kept her panties in there. Ned made a mental note to
                  check later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Carmen let go of Fluffy and looked at Ned. "Keep a really
                  close eye on him when you open the door. He likes to sneak
                  out. I was trying to carry in my groceries when he got past me
                  the last time."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Yep, got it." Ned said. "You're leaving Fluffy in great
                  hands."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "And call me if he does anything... weird." Carmen glanced
                  sideways at Fluffy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Weird like what?" Ned said. "He isn't going to hump my leg,
                  is he?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  "No. He's just been different since he got hurt." She let out
                  a breath and laughed. "Don't worry about it, I'm sure he'll be
                  fine."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Sure." If Fluffy humped his leg, Ned was going to kick the
                  shit out of him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Ok, I have to leave soon for my flight," Carmen said. She led
                  Ned back to the front door. "Thank you again for doing this.
                  My regular cat sitter bailed on me, and Fluffy is too weak to
                  be in a kennel around other cats. I really owe you."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Nah," Ned said. He could think of several things she could do
                  to pay him back. "I'm happy to help out. Fluffy and I are
                  going to have a good old time together."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Oh! I almost forgot." Carmen fished a key out of her pocket
                  and handed it to Ned. The bright pink metal key had a cartoon
                  cat logo printed on the head. This bitch would be a crazy cat
                  lady if she wasn't so hot. "Just stop by whenever it's most
                  convenient for you."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Great," Ned said. Now was as good a time as any to make his
                  move. He could give her a quick ride before she headed out of
                  town. He leaned in for a kiss.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Carmen stepped back. She grabbed the front door and opened it.
                  "So, yeah. I have to finish packing up and go," she said. She
                  gestured at the open doorway.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Yeah, sure," Ned said. It looked like he would have to wait
                  until she came back. At least taking care of her fleabag cat
                  should loosen her up. He stepped out onto the porch. "Enjoy
                  your cousin's wedding."
                </p>
                <p>"Thanks," Carmen said. She shut the door.</p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  The sun was low on the horizon when Ned returned a few hours
                  later. He checked to make sure Carmen's car was gone before he
                  parked. He didn't want her to catch him coming back so soon
                  and risk freaking her out. No one was home.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned opened the apartment door and flipped on the lights.
                  "Meow," Fluffy said. The fuzz-ball sat on the floor just
                  inside the apartment, staring up at Ned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Hey asshole," Ned said, closing the door behind him.
                  Something about the way the cat stared at him made Ned
                  uncomfortable. He shooed Fluffy away with his foot.
                </p>
                <p>"Meow," Fluffy said, a hint of anger in his voice.</p>
                <p>
                  Ned went to the kitchen and opened the fridge. Fluffy followed
                  him and sat on the kitchen floor. Ned dug through the fridge,
                  trying to find something good to eat. Carrots, spinach,
                  cottage cheese. Yuck. Carmen didn't keep any real food around.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned settled on the milk. He grabbed it and drank out of the
                  carton. "Meow," Fluffy said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned looked down. He took another swig of milk while making eye
                  contact with Fluffy. "Yeah, that's right," Ned said. "I'm the
                  man of the house now. Got that?" Fluffy didn't move. Ned
                  laughed at himself. What was he doing? Proving his manhood to
                  a cat? He stuffed the milk jug back in the fridge and closed
                  the door. When he looked back down at the floor, Fluffy was
                  gone.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Meow," Fluffy said, inches from Ned's ear. Ned fell back
                  against the kitchen sink and looked up. Fluffy sat on top of
                  the fridge, glaring down at Ned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "How did you get up there so fast?" Ned said. Fluffy stared at
                  him with unwavering eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Screw it. Ned wasn't going to let this cat ruin his good time.
                  He walked down the hall and turned on the lights in the
                  bedroom. He smiled. What would it be like to have sex with
                  Carmen on this bed? The thought made his groin ache.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned went to the dresser and pulled open the top drawer.
                  Jackpot. It was full of Carmen's underwear. He picked up a
                  pink lacy thong and ran his fingers over it. Carmen had worn
                  this, right up against her pussy. Ned felt warmth spreading
                  from his stomach into his whole body. He stuffed the panties
                  in his pocket, saving them for later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Meow," Fluffy said, his voice loud and insistent. Ned looked
                  back over his shoulder. Fluffy stood on the bed, watching Ned.
                  The cat's tail flicked back and forth, as if trying to tell
                  Ned that he shouldn't be in the room.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Buzz off, cat," Ned said. He turned back to the dresser and
                  tried to ignore Fluffy. He picked through the drawer, but the
                  fur-ball's constant screeching grated on him. Fluffy was
                  killing the mood.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Shut up!" Ned yelled. He turned and swung at Fluffy, hard
                  enough to backhand the cat across the room. Ned's aim was
                  perfect, but right before he made contact, Fluffy leapt into
                  the air. Ned missed. Fluffy back flipped twice and landed with
                  the grace of a gymnast on the far side of the mattress. Fluffy
                  hissed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "How the hell did you dodge that?" Ned looked at the bandages
                  around Fluffy's torso and narrowed his eyes. "I thought you
                  were supposed to be hurt."
                </p>
                <p>"Grrrrr," Fluffy said.</p>
                <p>
                  "Whatever," Ned said, but something about Fluffy unnerved him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned went to the living room and plopped down on the couch.
                  Dealing with this damn critter was more work than he expected.
                  He grabbed the remote and kicked his feet up, resting his
                  dirty tennis shoes on top of the "Kittens" picture book. He
                  turned on the TV. Carmen better have the premium channels.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fluffy hopped up on the coffee table. He stood with his back
                  arched slightly, staring at Ned. A deep, threatening growl
                  rose out of Fluffy's throat. Ned tried to ignore him and focus
                  on the TV, but it was impossible. Fluffy's stare cut into Ned
                  like a knife.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Enough of this. Ned put his feet down on the floor and leaned
                  forward. Fluffy didn't shy away, and Ned reached out and
                  grabbed him. "Time for solitary confinement, you little shit."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned stood up. He held Fluffy on the bandaged part of his torso
                  with both hands. Ned gave Fluffy a squeeze against his wounds,
                  just to hurt him a little. Fluffy needed to learn that Ned was
                  a human and that made him the boss.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fluffy squirmed. The cat was harder to hold onto than Ned
                  expected. Ned gripped down tighter, but he couldn't stop
                  Fluffy from twisting in his hands. Fluffy turned to the side
                  and bit into the meaty area between the thumb and index finger
                  of Ned's right hand. The pain was sharp and sudden.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Ah, fuck!" Ned said. He tried to pull Fluffy away, but Fluffy
                  reached out and sunk the claws of both of his front paws into
                  Ned's right forearm. "Aargh!" Ned ran down the hall to the
                  bathroom and stopped at the door. He grabbed Fluffy by the
                  scruff of the neck with his left hand and yanked as hard as he
                  could. Fluffy's teeth ripped a small chunk out of Ned's right
                  hand, and his claws sliced long gouges along Ned's forearm. He
                  screamed in pain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned flung Fluffy as hard as he could at the bathroom wall.
                  Fluffy twisted in midair, landed feet first against the wall,
                  pushed off, and jumped like a ninja. Fluffy landed on top of
                  the shower curtain rod and perched. The hair on his back stood
                  up, and he looked down at Ned and growled. Ned's jaw dropped.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "What the hell is going on?" Ned slammed the door and hurried
                  into the kitchen, cradling his bleeding arm. That damn cat was
                  insane. Ned should call animal control and have it put down.
                  He would be doing Carmen a favor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned turned on the faucet in the kitchen sink and ran his
                  wounds under the water. It stung. He grabbed a handful of
                  paper towels and wrapped himself up. His blood immediately
                  soaked into the towels and turned them red.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned pulled out his phone and started writing a text. "What the
                  fuck Carmen—," he typed. What should he say? That he came over
                  to her apartment to check on Fluffy only hours after she left?
                  That would raise questions that he didn't want to deal with.
                  He deleted the message.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned felt dizzy. He went to the living room and plopped down on
                  the couch. The local news was on. "And tonight's full moon
                  will be extra bright, if you can catch it between the
                  intermittent clouds," the weatherman said. "I for one am
                  heading out to get a moon tan." He laughed like a jackass and
                  joked with the news anchors. Ned stopped paying attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The last fading rays of sun shone through the living room
                  window. Ned was really tired. He closed his eyes and leaned
                  back into the soft couch. Just a quick nap. His thoughts would
                  be clearer when he woke up, and then he would figure out what
                  to do.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  Ned's eyes popped open. A noise had startled him awake. It was
                  dark outside, and a poorly written crime drama was playing on
                  TV. He muted the volume and listened. A loud thud came from
                  the bathroom. What the hell was Fluffy doing in there?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned stood up on shaky feet and checked out his wounded arm.
                  The hair on the back of his right hand seemed thicker and
                  darker than normal. That was weird. The thudding came again,
                  followed by a crash of breaking glass.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Hey stupid animal," Ned said, walking down the hall. He
                  stopped at the closed door. The noises from the other side
                  stopped. "I'm going to come in there now, okay. Just don't be
                  an asshole and I won't kick you."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned opened the door. The bathroom was dark, the light from the
                  hallway not strong enough to illuminate the room. What he
                  could see was a disaster. Strips of toilet paper littered the
                  floor and the bathmat was shredded. Two small points of light
                  stared at Ned from the darkness—Fluffy's eyes reflecting the
                  weak light.
                </p>
                <p>"I'm not cleaning this up," Ned said.</p>
                <p>
                  At that moment, the moon came out. The pink curtains covering
                  the bathroom window lit up with pale white light. Ned felt a
                  deep, aching pain in the wounds on his right arm, and Fluffy
                  started shaking uncontrollably and screeching. Ned flicked on
                  the bathroom light.
                </p>
                <p>He screamed.</p>
                <p>
                  Fluffy was twice as big as he should be, and he was growing
                  larger. The bandages on his torso ripped apart and fell to the
                  floor. His body elongated and swelled with thick muscles. His
                  paws expanded and grew opposable thumbs. When the
                  transformation stopped, Fluffy stood on his hind legs, a
                  three-foot tall monster. He lifted his head at the ceiling and
                  howled, "Meeooowwwwww!"
                </p>
                <p>
                  What the ever-loving fuck? Did Ned just watch Fluffy turn into
                  a... werecat? That was insane. Fluffy looked at Ned. That
                  little fucker looked hungry. Fluffy crouched, getting ready to
                  pounce. His tail flicked back and forth in the air, and he
                  growled like a tiger.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fluffy was ready for dinner and Ned was on the menu. Ned
                  grabbed the bathroom door and slammed it shut. Maybe werecats
                  were like house cats and were too stupid to open doors. Fluffy
                  rammed the door from the other side. A large crack split open
                  down the center of the door. Balls.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fluffy hit the door again and it exploded, and Ned was pelted
                  with splintered wood. He shielded his face and fell back
                  against the wall, trying to stay on his feet. Fluffy strode
                  through the door on his hind legs, his front paws balled into
                  tiny fists.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned looked over his shoulder. The front door seemed so far
                  away, and he didn't think he could outrun Fluffy. He had to
                  fight. Ned squared off against the creature. The cat was only
                  three feet tall, and Ned was a full-grown man. He could do
                  this. "I'm going to kick your ass."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned leaned over and swung downward, punching at Fluffy's head
                  as hard as he could. Fluffy just stepped to the side. The
                  werecat punched upward, his furry fist smashing like a rock
                  into Ned's jaw. Ned saw stars. Fluffy swiped with the claws on
                  his other hand, and they sliced through Ned's shirt and into
                  his skin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned stumbled backwards into the living room, trying to regain
                  his balance. He should have run. Fluffy jumped, and while in
                  midair, he backhanded Ned. Ned twisted and fell face-first
                  into the glass-topped coffee table, shattering it. He tumbled
                  onto the floor in a pile of glass shards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Oh, God," Ned groaned. Not like this. Don't go down like a
                  bitch. The "Kittens" picture book was lying on the ground near
                  his face. Ned grabbed it. Summoning all his strength, he
                  rolled onto his back and held the book out between him and the
                  werecat. "Hey Fluffy, look at these nice kitties. Don't you
                  want to be nice like them?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fluffy swiped the book out of Ned's hands. It crashed into the
                  TV and cracked the glass. Well damn. He was going to be eaten
                  alive by a fucking house cat. Fluffy hopped onto Ned's chest.
                  The werecat's sharp claws dug into his stomach. Ned shielded
                  his face with his bandaged right arm.
                </p>
                <p>Goodbye cruel world.</p>
                <p>
                  Fluffy froze. He leaned forward and sniffed the bloody paper
                  towels covering Ned's arm. Ned opened one eye and peeked at
                  Fluffy. The werecat's pupils shrank, and he locked eyes with
                  Ned. Then, of all things, Fluffy purred.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fluffy tilted his head up into the air and howled.
                  "Meeooowwwwww!" With that, Fluffy leapt off of Ned and crashed
                  through the living room window. Glass rained down on the
                  walkway outside, and cold air blew into the room. Ned heard
                  Fluffy's howl fading as the werecat ran off into the darkness.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  Ned clung to the steering wheel with sweaty hands. He leaned
                  forward and squinted at the dark road ahead. The clouds
                  covered the moon, and his headlights weren't penetrating the
                  darkness. Why was he having so much trouble focusing? He had
                  been feeling progressively worse on the drive home. A wave of
                  nausea hit him, and Ned swallowed hard so he wouldn't puke.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A werecat bit him. What happened to people in the stories?
                  They turned into to whatever were-fucking-animal bit them. No,
                  that couldn't happen to Ned. Fluffy bit him while in normal
                  cat form, so Ned wouldn't be infected. Right?
                </p>
                <p>
                  A bead of sweat dripped in his eye and he blinked it away. Ned
                  was close to his place. He would get home, take some aspirin,
                  and sleep it off. Tomorrow morning, this would all be a bad
                  dream. Everything was fine. He wished he never volunteered to
                  watch Carmen's damn cat. She was hot, but getting pussy wasn't
                  worth this mess.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He knocked over the trashcans on the curb when he pulled into
                  the parking lot at his apartment complex. It didn't matter.
                  Ned just needed to get inside. Get in the shower. Run cold
                  water on his burning skin. His entire body was on fire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned leaned against the car door and fumbled with the handle.
                  He pushed it open, lost his balance, and tumbled onto the
                  concrete. Every bone in his body ached, and the inside of his
                  skin itched. He lay there on the ground, panting, and trying
                  to muster the strength to stand. That's when the clouds parted
                  and moonlight poured over him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ned shrieked. The pain was unreal. The pale light burned like
                  boiling water. This can't be happening! Ned got his knees
                  under him and tried to stand, but his legs were spasming out
                  of control. He grabbed the car door for balance, and that's
                  when he caught his reflection in the side view mirror.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Black fur exploded out of his skin. Sharp fangs sprouted from
                  his mouth. His pupils narrowed to cat-like slits. Please,
                  anything but this. Ned fucking hated cats.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Meeooowwwwww!" Ned's werecat howl echoed in the night air.
                </p>
