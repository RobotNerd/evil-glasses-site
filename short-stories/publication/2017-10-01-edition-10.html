                <p>
                  Sorry if there are typos. It's hard to use a laptop now that
                  my hands aren't human anymore. I'm recounting my story for any
                  of you out there who don't remember the previous timeline.
                  Maybe one of you knows how to fix things.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before I entered the time portal, the military scientists
                  tried to explain the rules. I didn't get it. "You're sending
                  me back to before I had my accident, and it will be like it
                  never happened?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Correct," Walker said, pushing his glasses up higher on his
                  nose. "And, of course, the assassin's tool you carry was
                  manufactured prior to the target point. This ensures that it
                  will not disassemble into its precursors when making the
                  trip."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "What?" I looked down at the fake diamond ring on my hand,
                  which Walker had given me a few minutes earlier.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "It doesn't matter," Faraday said. She was fiddling with the
                  knobs on the time portal's control panel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "It's really quite simple," Walker said in a lecturing tone. I
                  could tell he wasn't intentionally trying to be obnoxious. He
                  was just an obnoxious person. "Any energy-matter signature
                  sent through the portal occupies its previous point in
                  spacetime. However, these events have not yet been applied to
                  your body's energy-matter signature at the target point in
                  spacetime."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Faraday noticed the <i>WTF</i> look on my face, and she butted
                  in. "It doesn't have to make sense. That's just how it is.
                  Accept it and focus on killing Arkin."
                </p>
                <p>
                  But wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. I need to go back
                  further. Back to the day of the accident that took my legs and
                  put me in a wheelchair. Back to the day I met Arkin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first class seat was worth the extra ninety dollars it
                  cost me to upgrade. I hadn't slept well the previous week.
                  Work sent me to Los Angeles for a conference, and I was never
                  comfortable in hotel rooms. I hoped to sleep the whole flight
                  back to New York.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A man was sitting in the window seat next to mine when I
                  boarded. His greasy hair was matted down against his head.
                  Clearly he wasn't a fan of hygiene. "Hi," he said when I sat
                  down. He showed a set of crooked teeth when he smiled.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Hi," I said. I avoided eye contact. No need to encourage an
                  airplane talker.
                </p>
                <p>"I'm going to turn everyone into airplanes," he said.</p>
                <p>
                  I sometimes wonder how things would have turned out if I had
                  asked the flight attendant to move me to another seat. But I
                  didn't. It was the weirdest thing I ever heard anyone say in
                  my life, and I had to know more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His name was Arkin, and he claimed to be a scientist of some
                  kind. "What kind of scientist can turn people into airplanes?"
                  I asked. "A geneticist? Nuclear physicist?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Something like that." I waited for more, but he didn't
                  elaborate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Ok, sure," I said, trying to keep a straight face. He
                  probably printed out and framed a "science" diploma from a
                  website. "So how do you go about turning people into
                  airplanes?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  "It's easier than you think." Arkin launched into a long
                  explanation and said a lot of sciency stuff that I didn't
                  understand. Retroviruses. Nanomachines. Reality distortion
                  manifolds. "Right now I can only convert one person at a time.
                  The hard part is figuring out how to do everyone at once."
                </p>
                <p>"But why airplanes? Why not animals, or furniture?"</p>
                <p>
                  Arkin looked out the window at the clouds drifting by. He ran
                  his finger down the inside of the plane, caressing the hard
                  plastic. "Because planes are beautiful."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "What if I don't want to be turned into an airplane?" I said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Most people are like you," he said. "They only see how things
                  are and not how things should be."
                </p>
                <p>"So you know what's best for everyone?" I said.</p>
                <p>"Yes," he said.</p>
                <p>
                  I rolled my eyes. "I don't believe anything you're saying."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Arkin nodded. "Of course not. But you will." He looked out the
                  window for the rest of the flight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We landed and I decided to take a taxi instead of the train.
                  While I waited in line for a cab, I wrote a Facebook post and
                  recounted every detail of my conversation with Arkin. I even
                  included a picture I surreptitiously took of him during the
                  flight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the ride home a truck rear-ended the cab at a stoplight.
                  One moment I was checking my phone to see if anyone had liked
                  my post yet, and the next my legs were crushed in a tangle of
                  metal. The cab driver didn't even get a bruise. There was
                  nothing the doctors could do. They amputated both of my legs
                  at the knee.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That was the end of my old life. I wish I could say I wasn't
                  bitter. I wish I could say that I overcame the odds and went
                  on to achieve great things in spite of my disability. I wish I
                  hadn't lost my legs. But no matter how hard I wished, I knew
                  that none of it would come true. So I stopped caring, got a
                  job I hated that allowed me to work from home, and I checked
                  out on life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A few years went by. One morning I was sipping my coffee when
                  I opened my laptop and read the news. There had been reports
                  about a new flu-like virus spreading for the last week, but no
                  one knew much about it. I wasn't concerned—there were a few
                  benefits of being a recluse. But the virus had taken a new
                  turn overnight. The first headline summed it up:
                  <i>Virus Turns People Into Airplanes</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My jaw hit the floor. It couldn't be. I opened the news
                  website and watched a shaky handheld video of a middle-aged
                  woman screaming and running into a field. She stumbled and
                  fell to her hands and knees, and her skin started swelling
                  outward like a balloon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What remained at the end of the transformation was an
                  abomination. It was the size and shape of a passenger jet but
                  composed of flesh. The fuselage was covered in skin, the
                  ailerons were made of fingers, and the vertical tail was bone.
                  The worst part were her eyes, stretched out in place of
                  cockpit windows and leaking giant tears.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There was a knock at my door. I opened it to find two serious
                  looking men in yellow hazmat suits. One of them held up his
                  phone so that the screen faced me. "Ma'am, did you write this
                  Facebook post?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  That's how I found myself in a giant military facility buried
                  deep under a mountain in an undisclosed location. They stuck
                  me in a bleak, gray interrogation room by myself. I could see
                  my reflection in the one-way mirror, and I wondered if anyone
                  watched me from the other side.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After hours of waiting, the door opened and a woman wearing a
                  white lab coat walked in. The name patch sewn onto her lab
                  coat read Faraday. "Sorry to keep you waiting," Faraday said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I don't know why you people hauled me off to this place, but
                  I know you aren't stupid enough to believe that I had
                  something to do with this virus because of a Facebook post—"
                </p>
                <p>
                  Faraday held up her hand and cut me off. "We have a lot to
                  talk about," she said. "I'll answer your questions while we
                  go." She nodded her head toward the hallway. "After you."
                </p>
                <p>
                  I thought about staying in place just to piss her off, but my
                  curiosity was stronger than my anger. They didn't bring me
                  here for fun. I had to know what the military wanted out of a
                  disabled recluse. I wheeled myself out into the long, plain
                  hallway. The walls were the same drab gray as everything else.
                  "What am I doing here?" I said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Three years ago, you sat on a flight beside a man named
                  Ulrich Arkin." Faraday led me deeper into the facility. We
                  passed plain metal doors, identical except for the room
                  numbers on plates beside each one. "He told you he was going
                  to turn people into airplanes."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Yeah, I thought he was crazy," I said. "I guess he wasn't."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Anyone who engineers a virus that turns people into airplanes
                  is the definition of crazy," Faraday said. She stopped at room
                  834R and swiped her ID badge. The door slid opened on its own,
                  and I rolled myself through into a large, cavernous room. In
                  the center, a glowing bluish sphere floated in the air. Its
                  surface shimmered like water rushing in a stream.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "What is that?" I stared at the glowing sphere, mesmerized.
                  The pale light grew until it consumed my vision. My body
                  became weightless and I floated away into space. I drifted
                  past stars, black holes, entire galaxies, and ultimately into
                  the pure void beyond existence itself. I was one with the
                  infinite unknown.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "It's a time portal," Faraday said. I snapped back to reality.
                  She grabbed the handles of my wheelchair and pushed me to the
                  edge of the room, parking me by a table. Another
                  scientist—Walker—was there, holding a metal briefcase. "But
                  we'll get to that in a minute. First, we need to talk about
                  how you're going to kill Arkin."
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm not dense. I've seen plenty of science fiction movies. "No
                  way. I'm not going back in time to be your assassin. Send
                  somebody else."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "There is no one else," Walker said. "You are the only
                  available vector pinpointing the target at any known point in
                  spacetime."
                </p>
                <p>"Huh?" I said.</p>
                <p>
                  "There are limitations," Faraday said. "It's only possible for
                  a person to travel back to a time and place they previously
                  experienced, and they only go back for a period of twenty-four
                  hours."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "There must be a lot of other people who can do it. Someone
                  else who knew Arkin," I said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Walker put the briefcase down on the table and opened it.
                  Inside was a small jewelry box packed in foam, the kind meant
                  to hold an engagement ring. "All of our other potentials have
                  been infected or completed the transformation. You're the only
                  one left."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Faraday leaned over and put her hands on my shoulders. She
                  looked into my eyes. "You're our only chance. If you don't
                  succeed, the human species is done."
                </p>
                <p>
                  I looked down at my lap. In that moment, I thought about how I
                  had given up on life the day that I lost my legs. There was
                  nothing I wanted, no goal to live for. I just existed. And now
                  I finally had a chance to do something important. "Yes," I
                  said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Walker nodded. He opened the jewelry box, pulled out a simple
                  diamond ring, and held it out for me. I reached for it, but
                  Walker pulled it back a hair. "Careful. It's full of poison."
                </p>
                <p>
                  A half hour later, my wheelchair sat on the edge of the
                  platform at the precipice of the portal. I wore the diamond
                  ring on my finger, careful not to touch it and accidentally
                  deploy the miniature needle on the bottom. Walker called the
                  ring a "CIA Special."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Walker and Faraday stood to either side of me. I looked up at
                  Faraday. "So I'm going to do this and everything will reset
                  back to normal. Like nothing ever happened?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  Faraday put her hands on her hips. "I know you're thinking
                  about changing your own past. You'll avoid the accident that
                  took your legs and then you'll try to invest in stocks or
                  something."
                </p>
                <p>She must be able to read minds. "I wasn't—"</p>
                <p>
                  Faraday cut me off. "Go right ahead. We don't care, as long as
                  you complete your mission first." I felt a surge of hope. If I
                  did this right, would I be able to walk again? Before I could
                  dwell on it, Faraday and Walker grabbed me under my shoulders
                  and lifted me out of my wheelchair. "You ready?" Faraday said.
                </p>
                <p>I wasn't. "Yeah," I said, taking a deep breath.</p>
                <p>
                  "We're counting on you," Faraday said. She and Walker tossed
                  me forward into the abyss.
                </p>
                <p>"I'm going to turn everyone into airplanes," Arkin said.</p>
                <p>
                  I was back on the same airplane. Back in the past. I couldn't
                  believe it worked. I looked down, past my knees, at the old
                  legs I used to have before they were amputated. I lifted up my
                  right one, then my left, then I kicked them back and forth,
                  laughing like a kid.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "They're back!" I yelled. I jumped up and danced in the aisle.
                  I forgot how fantastic of a feeling it was to be on real legs.
                  I started doing jumping jacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Ma'am, please take your seat," the flight attendant said. She
                  gave me the evil eye. "People are trying to board."
                </p>
                <p>
                  I plopped down in my seat, grinning ear to ear. "Hmm," Arkin
                  said. He looked at me like I was the weirdo. What an unusual
                  feeling, having a monster think you're strange.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I remembered why I was there. The diamond on top of the ring
                  shifted when I pressed it, causing the tiny needle to extend
                  out from the bottom part of the band. I leaned over, grabbed
                  the back of Arkin's hand, and I whispered, "You aren't going
                  to turn anybody into anything."
                </p>
                <p>
                  It bothered me that I didn't hesitate. Sure, Arkin was a
                  maniac who tried to wipe out the human race for his own
                  personal art project. But that was him. I always thought of
                  myself as the type of person who would be incapable of taking
                  the life of even the most despicable person.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Arkin pulled his hand away and rubbed it. He would have only
                  felt a tiny pinprick, and he probably thought that my ring
                  merely scratched him. "Most people are like you," he said. His
                  eyelids drooped a little. "They only see how things are and
                  not how things should be."
                </p>
                <p>"I've seen a lot of things today," I said.</p>
                <p>
                  "I know you don't believe me," Arkin said. He swayed like he
                  had too much to drink. "But you will."
                </p>
                <p>"You feeling ok?" I said, pretending to be concerned.</p>
                <p>Arkin rubbed his temple. "No. I'm suddenly very tired."</p>
                <p>"Why don't you lie back?" I said.</p>
                <p>
                  Arkin sat back and leaned against the side of the plane. He
                  closed his eyes. I watched him until his breathing stopped. He
                  was dead by the time we were in the air. The flight attendant
                  assumed that Arkin was sleeping, and when we landed, I got off
                  the plane before anyone figured out he was dead.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then I <i>walked</i> out of the terminal on my <i>legs</i>!
                  Arkin was already out of my mind. I skipped the taxi this time
                  around and opted for the train. I had a very safe and
                  uneventful ride back to the city. I spent all afternoon in the
                  park, walking every trail and going up and down every set of
                  stairs I could find. When I finally made it home, I took a
                  nice long bath, shaved my legs, and savored the feeling of the
                  razor sliding over my skin. I drifted to sleep that night
                  curled up in a ball so I could hug my shins.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This morning I woke up, back in the present. The good news is
                  my legs are still attached to my body. The bad news is I'm a
                  bear. Like the animal. Brown, furry, and I guess about five
                  hundred pounds. My bed broke under my weight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My best guess is that Arkin wasn't working alone. Whoever his
                  partner or partners were, they continued his work and took it
                  in a different direction. Like you, I've seen the news, and I
                  know I'm not the only one who woke up as a bear today.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you ever had a random conversation with a stranger who
                  talked about turning people into bears, please write about it
                  on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and every other social
                  network you can think of. Pray that there is enough of a
                  functioning government left to spy on our conversations and
                  that they still developed time travel in this timeline. I
                  don't want to live the rest of my life like this.

                <p>
                  Natalie had almost always despised her life. The normal joys
                  like marriage, career, and children were not joys as much as a
                  chore she willingly added to her life. She liked to travel but
                  the sinking feeling of real life was never far away. She liked
                  to cook but the reason she liked to cook was because she had a
                  family that she had to take care of. Aside from that, she was
                  resigned to her existence and did little to change it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once her son moved out she proclaimed all her actions to be
                  for herself, this was her time to explore the possibilities.
                  That selfishness didn't help either. Her husband ceaselessly
                  annoyed her and she did nothing to hide it. Her son was
                  floundering in the lackluster existence he chose and she
                  didn't care to pry. She was in her last years before an early
                  retirement from her tax firm.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She was resolved for it to go on like that until the end. Her
                  attempts and failures caught up to her so now that retirement
                  loomed closer she was panicked to be alone with herself. She
                  thought to start traveling in earnest, the constant worry that
                  brought would be keep her from really thinking about what her
                  life had become, who she was going to be, and who she was
                  going to be with through the rest of her life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That all changed, though, when she realized she was in love
                  with another man.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  “Come in! Come in!” Natalie's friend Kate said as she moved
                  aside and gestured to walk through. Natalie and her husband
                  Dean walked in, smiles on their faces.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Natalie liked Kate a lot. Kate was outspoken and charming,
                  sometimes aggressive but also happy, always honest and knew
                  her own faults.
                </p>
                <p>“Thank you, Kate!” Natalie said.</p>
                <p>
                  Dean handed Kate a covered pie pan. “Here's the dessert.” Dean
                  lightly clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was a habit of Dean's to click his tongue after he was done
                  talking. Natalie had hoped one day she wouldn't hear it
                  anymore, that it would fade into the background and would only
                  come up when someone asked what that noise was without
                  realizing it was coming from Dean. But it hadn't. She heard it
                  every time. Every damn time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kate's husband, Warren, stepped out from the kitchen removing
                  an apron from his waist. “Natalie, Dean,” he said to them with
                  a nod.
                </p>
                <p>Natalie was in love with Warren.</p>
                <p>
                  He shook Dean's hand and then went in to hug her. She took his
                  shoulders in her hands and kept him distant. She grew unable
                  to be near him without loathing her feelings so it was best to
                  always feign some sickness, some pain in her shoulder, to keep
                  some obstacle in the way of his friendly greeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Can I get you guys something to drink? Wine? Beer?” Warren
                  said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kate linked arms with Natalie, “I just opened a bottle of
                  wine.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Natalie smiled and went with her friend to the dining room
                  just outside of the kitchen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I'll take a beer.” Dean clicked his tongue and went with
                  Warren outside to the barbeque.
                </p>
                <p>Kate handed Natalie a glass of wine.</p>
                <p>“So, how are you?” Natalie asked taking a sip.</p>
                <p>
                  “Oh, I'm good. Just always something with these young girls at
                  the office,” Kate started.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Natalie knew everything was perfect for Kate. She had Warren,
                  the reason why Kate was also so happy, so cheerful, so
                  positive.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  Natalie and Kate met at a community get-together and hit it
                  off. A dinner invitation was extended. They found out that the
                  four of them had similar interests and enjoyed being around
                  each other. Something Natalie was surprised to find in anyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When she thought about Warren, after first meeting him, there
                  was no spark, no wild wonderment, no longing. He and Kate were
                  happily married and she and Dean, in her opinion only, were
                  not. That was all her life was going to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Warren was a quiet man but calculated, strong, and smart.
                  Natalie found herself watching him and noticing his minute
                  movements, listening to how he formed sentences, and noticed
                  his smile at clever things she would say.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The day that did it was when Natalie watched Warren remove a
                  peach pit from Kate's peach without Kate asking or even
                  addressing that it had happened. Warren didn't pay any mind
                  either. He just casually reached over, took the peach from
                  Kate, pulled out the pit, and handed it back to her. He didn't
                  even take a bite.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Natalie thought about that peach for days and snapped at Dean
                  any slim chance that may have warranted a snapping at. Dean
                  had never and would never do anything like that for her.
                </p>
                <p>Warren made Natalie feel like she could be happy.</p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  Natalie and Kate sat at the table with their wine glasses and
                  small plates with cracker crumbs and streaks of dip left on
                  them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “It's like he never sees things that are right in front of
                  him. I had to get up, walk over to him, grab it, which was
                  right next to him, and hand it to him.” Kate chuckled at the
                  story she told of Warren.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Natalie smiled and chuckled too. Dean had been keeping to
                  himself at home recently so Natalie didn't even have the
                  opportunity to interact with him, even if the chances were
                  high that it would be negative.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Avoiding having to insert an anecdote about their home life,
                  Natalie asked, “Are Warren and Dean going to come in for
                  appetizers?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Let me go see what they're doing.” Kate got up and headed out
                  to check on them.
                </p>
                <p>Natalie looked at her plate with the crumbs.</p>
                <p>
                  Now she was aware that everything in the house was Warren's.
                  He'd touched everything, held everything, remembered every
                  story behind the house. And that the whole house and
                  everything in it was also Kate's and would never be hers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She ran her finger along the rim of her appetizer plate. A
                  little chipped plate that didn't match the other little
                  plates. Did he drop it in the sink while rinsing it off? Did
                  he pick it up and examine the chip running his finger across
                  it as she just had? Did he decide that even with its small
                  imperfection that it was still a whole plate to be used?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Warren came through the back yard door and shut it behind
                  himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Warren.” Natalie tried to hide the red heat that was crawling
                  up her neck, feeling exposed to her thoughts of him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He went to the kitchen and washed his hands. “Dinner's just
                  about done,” he said as he dried his hands and leaned against
                  the countertop.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Do you need any help?” She met him in the kitchen and leaned
                  the side of her hip against the same countertop so she faced
                  him.
                </p>
                <p>“No, I think we have it handled.”</p>
                <p>He held the white thin towel he used.</p>
                <p>“Where are Dean and Kate?”</p>
                <p>“Dean took a call. Kate is walking the garden.”</p>
                <p>
                  Here he was. With her. Alone. She looked at his big, weathered
                  hands. She wanted to take his hands and hold them tight. She
                  wanted to lean in and kiss him softly on his cheek. She wanted
                  to say, I want us to be together, I love you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “You can help yourself to more wine. We have plenty.” This was
                  a variation of Warren's canned lines. Multiple times a night
                  he would offer more wine and food.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I—I,” her mind was foggy as she stepped out of her thoughts,
                  “my glass is over there. Let me grab it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  She picked up her glass and went back to Warren settling
                  herself closer to him in the kitchen. She put her glass on the
                  counter and Warren left her side to fill it with more wine.
                </p>
                <p>“Do you have a glass?” she asked. “How about a toast?”</p>
                <p>
                  Warren smiled and handed her back her glass. “I don't. My beer
                  is outside.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “That's fine.” The familiarity of disappointment dogged her.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He held the bottle and studied the label that was nondescript.
                  “If I remember correctly we got this one last fall,” he said
                  idly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Natalie went to him and took the bottle out of his hand. She
                  put in on the counter. “Warren,” she said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He looked at her, his face plain. She grabbed at the hand that
                  held the bottle but it was awkward, she only managed to
                  capture his thumb and first two fingers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Warren,” she said again. Her mind was racing as she looked in
                  his eyes trying to show what she couldn't say with words. She
                  squeezed his hand but what she actually wanted to do was to
                  put herself against him and stay there curled in his arms.
                </p>
                <p>“Let go of my hand,” he said.</p>
                <p>
                  She quickly pulled her hand away, took up her glass, and
                  stepped back to lean against the countertop.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Natalie felt no heat from him, no movement, he only let her
                  touch his hand. Her heart hurt at the pass she just made.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Dinner at our house next week, say Wednesday?” She said
                  trying to save herself from Warren's cold reaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But without that reaction Natalie wouldn't love Warren so
                  much. He was what she wanted him to be, completely immune to
                  other women around him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kate came through the door carrying a small basket filled with
                  cherry tomatoes. Natalie's face reddened when she saw Kate and
                  noticed that Warren didn't move an inch.
                </p>
                <p>“Dinner Wednesday at Natalie and Dean's,” Warren said.</p>
                <p>
                  Kate nodded. “Perfect! Natalie, do you want some of these to
                  take home tonight?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dean came through the door. “That guy can talk, I tell you.
                  Sorry about that.” He clicked his tongue.
                </p>
                <p>“Not a problem,” Warren said.</p>
                <p>
                  “Natalie, I'm going to put these in a plastic bag for you,”
                  Kate said as she crossed the kitchen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Warren looked at Natalie. “You don't have to take them if you
                  don't want them.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  She gave a small shake of her head. “No, I'd—I'd like to have
                  them.”
                </p>
