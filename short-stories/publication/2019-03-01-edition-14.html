                <p>
                  Jack lumbered down the hallway, his footsteps echoing on the
                  marble floor. His feet felt comfortable in his brand new
                  patent leather shoes by Kerrigan. He was a big man, though the
                  Weight Handlers Diet Rush pills were helping him drop the
                  pounds. The double doors to Harvey's office were open, but he
                  stopped at the edge and knocked anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Harvey looked up from his glossy mahogany desk, handmade by
                  the seasoned craftsmen of the Fairchild Furniture Supply. He
                  looked over the rim of his Boff Thompson reading glasses and
                  waved his hand. "Come in, Jack! Take a seat."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jack nodded and smiled, trying to ignore the butterflies in
                  his stomach. He envied the hell out of Harvey. The old bastard
                  built the advertising agency from the ground up, and he had
                  certainly earned every penny of it. Jack was just glad that
                  Harvey seemed to like him. He hoped that could work to his
                  advantage today.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jack sat down in the soft leather chair--also by Fairchild
                  Furniture--in front of Harvey's desk. It was so soft and
                  inviting that it eased his nerves a bit. "How are you Harvey?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Great, great. Better than ever," Harvey said. He leaned back,
                  kicked his feet up on his desk, and propped his hands behind
                  his head. Harvey had to be pushing seventy, but he had the
                  energy of a much younger man. "So Jack, let's get straight to
                  the point. What's this new proposal you have for me?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  No beating around the bush. Jack liked that about Harvey. Jack
                  leaned forward. "I want to insert live advertisements in
                  books."
                </p>
                <p>Harvey furrowed his brow. "What's that now?"</p>
                <p>
                  "Let me explain," Jack said. He got up out of the chair and
                  walked back and forth in front of Harvey's desk while he
                  talked. "Nobody reads regular books anymore, right?
                  Everything's an eBook now. And there's one thing about
                  eBooks--they aren't set in stone."
                </p>
                <p>"You mean because they're digital," Harvey said.</p>
                <p>
                  "Exactly," Jack said, pointing at Harvey. "They're digital and
                  they're always connected to the internet. What that gives us
                  is a brand new opportunity for ad placement."
                </p>
                <p>"Hmm," Harvey said, stroking his chin. "Go on."</p>
                <p>
                  Jack smiled. The pitch was going just like he had hoped. "The
                  boys downstairs came up with a way to inject targeted
                  advertising directly into eBooks. And it uses AI."
                </p>

                <p>"Like a robot?" Harvey said.</p>
                <p>
                  "Bingo!" Jack said, pointing his finger at Harvey. "Exactly
                  like a robot."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Harvey took off his Boff Thompson reading glasses and looked
                  up at the ceiling. Jack could see the gears turning in the old
                  man's head, and he knew that Harvey was working out the
                  implications. "I haven't heard about anything like this
                  before. Could give us a leg up over the competition. How's it
                  work?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  "There's three ways we can do ad placement," Jack said. "The
                  first is inline product placement." Jack paused for a moment,
                  letting that sink in. Harvey waved his hand impatiently,
                  signaling for Jack to continue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Let's say you have a story about a well-to-do businessman,"
                  Jack said, nodding towards Harvey. "He's sitting at his desk,
                  doing some paperwork, and he checks the time. Our product can
                  intelligently edit the text of the story and insert a brand
                  name for that watch."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Huh," Harvey said, looking at the gold Folex watch he was
                  wearing on his wrist. "So we set up a deal with a company like
                  Folex, and then we put their name in the story. Kind of like a
                  mad lib."
                </p>
                <p>"Exactly," Jack said, giving Harvey a thumbs-up.</p>
                <p>
                  "And it does this regardless of what the author writes?"
                  Harvey said.
                </p>
                <p>"Yep," Jack said. "It's out of their control."</p>
                <p>"What's the second type?" Harvey said.</p>
                <p>"Ad breaks," Jack said.</p>
                <p>"Like a TV commercial?" Harvey said.</p>
                <p>"Like a TV commercial," Jack said.</p>

                  "I don't know, Jack," Harvey said. "That sounds a little
                  intrusive. Now, I'm not much of a reader, but I feel like that
                  would turn off users."

                <p>
                  "Have you seen the kids these days," Jack said. He waved his
                  hands in the air. "They're all doing their Instasnaps and
                  Tweetchats. They have the attention span of Rhesus monkeys.
                  Breaking up stories will probably increase their involvement."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "You know, my granddaughters are always messing around with
                  their eDevice phones," Harvey said. "I don't get any of that
                  crap. You may be onto something with that." Harvey leaned
                  forward and put his elbows on his desk. "You said there were
                  three things. What's the third?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yes! Jack was nailing this pitch. He smiled wide. "Well, it's
                  something we can use in combination with the other two. We can
                  leverage big data and deep learning to provide targeted ads
                  specific to the current reader."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Whoa there Jack," Harvey said, holding his hands up in the
                  air. "That kind of tech talk goes right over my head. You have
                  to dumb it down for me."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "No problem," Harvey said. "Let's say that you're a typical
                  book person, and we've been buying your internet search
                  history. This AI can predict, say, that you're thinking about
                  a tool. We can insert a targeted ad based on what we think
                  you're thinking."

                  over the city. "Jack my boy, I think you're onto something."

                  Jack felt his heart pounding in his chest. This was great! He

                <p>
                  Jack swallowed. Uh oh. He forced a smile. "There's just one

                  "The engineers say it is, and I'm inclined to believe them.
                  They're a smart bunch of fellows." Jack had been pushing them
                  day and night to come up with a solution, but everything they
                  tried so far had failed.

                </p>
                <p>"No, no," Jack said. "Nothing like that."</p>
                <p>"What are you doing to handle it?" Harvey said.</p>

                  Jack shrugged. "For now, the guys just reboot the server every
                  day to wipe out its memory. It's working so far."

                  "Well then, I'm sure your guys will work it out," Harvey said.
                  He walked across the room, smiled, and gave Jack a firm
                  handshake. "You have a good head on your shoulders, my boy."

                <p>
                  I took her hand in mine as we walked away from our office
                  building to get an afternoon cup of coffee.
                </p>
                <p>“I thought about you all weekend,” I said.</p>
                <p>“So you guys weren't doing much then?” she asked.</p>
                <p>
                  “No,” I shook my head and pulled her in to give her a side hug
                  as we walked, dodging others on their way, “we went to dinner
                  Saturday, lunch on Sunday. We put up some shelves she'd made.”
                </p>
                <p>She sighed and I knew why.</p>
                <p>“I know. We didn't expect this so it's weird.”</p>
                <p>“I want you to tell her.”</p>
                <p>
                  We were silent walking through the door of our favorite coffee
                  shop. I held her close to me as we stood in line. I ran my
                  fingers through her long hair. My girlfriend has short hair, I
                  can't do this with her.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She held onto me and rubbed her hands up and down my lower
                  back. I don't know when she started that habit but she's the
                  only one that's ever done that.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I love you,” I said as I pressed the side of my face against
                  the side of her head.
                </p>
                <p>She squeezed me.</p>
                <p>“What did you do this weekend?” I asked.</p>
                <p>
                  “Did some spring cleaning. Organized. I talked with my mom.”
                </p>
                <p>“How is she?”</p>
                <p>“Old and tired. It's still cold there.”</p>
                <p>She ordered a small latte. I ordered a black tea.</p>
                <p>We stood to the side and waited.</p>
                <p>“I don't like that you're like this,” I said.</p>
                <p>“Like what?”</p>
                <p>
                  “Sad? Disappointed? I don't know exactly what you are but
                  you're not yourself.”
                </p>
                <p>“I am not myself.”</p>
                <p>
                  The barista called our order. We left holding hands. Once we
                  were out of the door and headed back to the office, I pulled
                  her to me and wrapped my arm around her.
                </p>
                <p>“I'll tell her tonight.”</p>
                <p>She pulled away from me. “Really?”</p>
                <p>I looked in her eyes and nodded. “Yeah.”</p>
                <p>
                  She kissed me and placed her hand on the side of my face. She
                  was happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Babe, are you home?” I closed the door behind me. The living
                  room light was on.
                </p>
                <p>“I'm here!” She called back from the bedroom.</p>
                <p>
                  I put my backpack down next to the couch and she came out and
                  wrapped her arms around my neck. We kissed hello like we do
                  everyday.
                </p>
                <p>“How was the traffic?” she asked, still hugging me.</p>
                <p>
                  I hugged her back. She was so familiar. I held her tighter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Same as usual. I'm going to try going down Westlake so I
                  don't get stuck behind people getting on the freeway. Did you
                  pick out a place to eat?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Yep,” she pulled away from me but kissed me again before
                  getting her phone. “It's just down the street. I thought we
                  could walk.”
                </p>
                <p>“Yeah, let's do it.”</p>
                <p>
                  I walked into the bedroom and closed my eyes while I thought
                  about telling her that this was it. Say it with the first
                  drink, wait until we're both almost done, the second drink?
                </p>
                <p>
                  She came in the room and changed her shirt. She smiled at me.
                  “What?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  My lips pulled into a smile and my heart swelled a little.
                  “Nothing.”
                </p>
                <p>“Are you going to change or anything or are you ready?”</p>
                <p>“I can go just like this.”</p>
                <p>“Let's go.”</p>
                <p>
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p>I was quiet on the way. She didn't ask me why.</p>
                <p>
                  We sat down at a small two-person wood table right away. The
                  place was half full. A waiter was over quickly to get our
                  drink order.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Hey, so,” I put my hand out on the table and she took it.
                  “Somethings have come up and I'm hoping that you understand.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  She waited patiently for me to continue but the pulse in my
                  neck kept me from talking.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My phone buzzed with a text. I glanced down. It was from “Stas
                  Baboi.”
                </p>
                <p>“What's up?” she asked me.</p>
                <p>
                  That's her. I kept her under the name of an offshore resource
                  at work that I was able to weave into stories. I unlocked the
                  phone and opened the text.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The text read,
                  <i
                    >Don't tell her. I thought about it and I don't want to be
                    with you anymore.</i
                  >
                </p>
                <p>“Hey?” she shook my hand.</p>
                <p>“Sorry.” I locked my phone and put it face down.</p>
                <p>“What was that?”</p>
                <p>“Nothing.”</p>
                <p>“Are you okay?”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, just frustrating work stuff.”</p>
                <p>
                  “Oh,” she rubbed my hand. “You'll take care of it. You're
                  great and they're lucky to still have you.”
