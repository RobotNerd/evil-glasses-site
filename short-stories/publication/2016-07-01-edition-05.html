                <p>Thanks.</p>
                <p>Anything good happen yet?</p>
                <p>I feel like the sky is greener than usual.</p>
                <p>
                  Might be that EXT382-B finally set. Move your chair a little,
                  my knees feel cramped.
                </p>
                <p>Yes, sorry.</p>
                <p>See those people over there?</p>
                <p>No.</p>
                <p>Over there. Right there.</p>
                <p>Yes, yes, I see them now.</p>
                <p>Do you know them?</p>
                <p>
                  No, I don't. So many more people show up here now. Most of
                  them don't stick around to talk.
                </p>
                <p>We should scare them away.</p>
                <p>Don't think like that. Let them be.</p>
                <p>We used to know everyone that showed up.</p>
                <p>And today it's fine that it's just them and us.</p>
                <p>That's fucked.</p>
                <p>But that's the way things go.</p>
                <p>They probably don't even know—</p>
                <p>Oh, look over there, look!</p>
                <p>Shit, shit, where are you pointing?</p>
                <p>
                  Right over there, follow my arm. You see where the cloud is
                  pushing?
                </p>
                <p>There it is. I see it.</p>
                <p>They're seeing it too. Good for them for noticing.</p>
                <p>It's not good and they need to calm the fuck down.</p>
                <p>
                  You can't deny that it is exciting. You shouldn't fault them
                  for that.
                </p>
                <p>I hope it's a flat day, that way they don't come back.</p>
                <p>
                  Well, I hope it isn't! I was really hoping to see one today.
                </p>
                <p>Fine, I hope one comes out once they leave.</p>
                <p>I guess that's fine.</p>
                <p>Shh! Did you hear that?</p>
                <p>No, I don't hear—</p>
                <p>Shh.</p>
                <p>I think it's just the wind.</p>
                <p>Shhh!</p>
                <p>It's them talking.</p>
                <p>Ah, you're right. Shit.</p>
                <p>I think they're on a date.</p>
                <p>Jesus, a date?</p>
                <p>
                  It is serene and romantic up here. There's going to be a lot
                  more people showing up.
                </p>
                <p>Fuck that.</p>
                <p>
                  If we were able to come upon this place others were bound to,
                  as well.
                </p>
                <p>Okay, I get it. It just sucks.</p>
                <p>Luxury condos will go right where we're sitting.</p>
                <p>Are you fucking serious? That's fucked. When?</p>
                <p>I'm just joking.</p>
                <p>That's a horrible joke.</p>
                <p>Look, it's happening again.</p>
                <p>
                  It's bigger this time. It probably will happen with them here.
                </p>
                <p>Oh, let it go. My feet are tingling.</p>
                <p>Why?</p>
                <p>It's exciting.</p>
                <p>I know. It's just the way you say it.</p>
                <p>
                  Most everyone would want to see one. You can't blame people
                  for that.
                </p>
                <p>Blame isn't the right word. I just don't want them here.</p>
                <p>You mean you don't want this to change?</p>
                <p>I don't want other people here.</p>
                <p>Isn't that the same thing?</p>
                <p>
                  This isn't like a restaurant where if people don't show up it
                  closes.
                </p>
                <p>So what do you think will happen?</p>
                <p>That we'll never see one again. Okay? Jesus.</p>
                <p>
                  Oh, well, that is a scary thought. But do you actually think
                  that?
                </p>
                <p>
                  I don't know, maybe. I just don't want to get to the point
                  where it might happen.
                </p>
                <p>Ah! That was loud!</p>
                <p>Damn, that made you jump.</p>
                <p>There, there! A fin!</p>
                <p>It's purple? Am I seeing that right?</p>
                <p>Yes, it looks like it is.</p>
                <p>Shit. Have we ever seen a purple fin?</p>
                <p>No. I would have remembered something like this.</p>
                <p>It's coming through.</p>
                <p>Oh my God, she's pink. She's amazing.</p>
                <p>She's huge, way bigger than normal. Here she comes.</p>
                <p>
                  Her whole body is pink. We've never seen a pink whale. She's
                  the size of the sky.
                </p>
                <p>No, not that big. She's coming right towards us.</p>
                <p>She can't see us though.</p>
                <p>I read that they could. They're scared over there.</p>
                <p>You should watch her instead of them.</p>
                <p>She's turning back.</p>
                <p>Wow. She was great. Our first and maybe our only one.</p>
                <p>They're packing up.</p>
                <p>Stop worrying about them.</p>
                <p>
                  I can't believe they saw a rare whale their first time out.
                </p>
                <p>It might not be their first time.</p>
                <p>
                  First time here then. It's taken us this long to see one and
                  they see it their first time.
                </p>
                <p>Does being upset about it change anything?</p>
                <p>What are you talking about?</p>
                <p>Will people stop coming if you stay angry about it?</p>
                <p>I hope so.</p>
                <p>
                  The real answer is no. So why stay angry? You can simply enjoy
                  what we saw today and hope that we see one again tomorrow.
                </p>
                <p>Look, they waved.</p>
                <p>See, they even acknowledged us.</p>
                <p>Yeah.</p>
                <p>Do you have to go?</p>
                <p>No. Do you?</p>
                <p>Nope. Maybe she'll come back.</p>

                <p>
                  The last humans on Earth lived in a small farming community
                  known as Stonekeep Village. The Great Annihilation that
                  destroyed almost all of their civilization was remembered only
                  as a myth, and the giant robotic leviathans frozen mid-battle
                  in the distance were worshipped by them as angry gods. Calvin
                  was born and raised into this harsh life, but he had dreams of
                  being something more. Little did he know that his choices
                  would restart an ancient war.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On a warm summer afternoon, Calvin stood in front of the
                  seven-member council of elders. The chamber hall was packed,
                  and all eyes were on him. "You're just going to let him die?"
                  Calvin said. His face was red with anger.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "There's nothing else we can do, boy," Councilwoman Verna said
                  in her always condescending tone. Though Calvin was in his
                  early twenties, he had no children and was thus not considered
                  a man.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Uncle Seamus wouldn't give up on us if we were hurt," Calvin
                  said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Tetra Nova Silver-Series Humanoid War Machine<b>™</b>
                  —known only as Uncle Seamus to the humans—was the protector of
                  Stonekeep village. He sustained a severe injury from a laser
                  cannon during the Annihilation, which damaged over
                  seventy-five percent of his memory circuits. Through a series
                  of coincidences, the malfunctioning robot found himself
                  guarding a group of grade-school children whose parents were
                  all dead.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The two battling artificial intelligences entered a stalemate,
                  and the war seemed to end. Seamus continued protecting those
                  children against the remnants of war, particularly the
                  cybernetic death machines known as razorbacks that were
                  designed to kill man and machine alike. Many of those children
                  survived into adulthood and had children of their own. This
                  continued generation after generation, though Seamus could not
                  track time with his broken memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After hundreds of years of relative success, luck ran out for
                  Seamus. Earlier that same morning, a razorback attacked a
                  group of villagers tending the cornfield. Seamus descended
                  from his lookout spot on Knob Hill, his ten foot tall legs
                  covering the distance faster than any horse could run. He
                  fought the razorback brilliantly, easily dodging its many
                  clawed tentacles and pounding its one-eyed torso with his
                  massive fists. Sadly, he did not see the second razorback
                  hiding in the corn stalks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Verna shook her head and spoke like she would to a small
                  child. "Seamus has reached the end of his journey, Calvin. The
                  gods have taken offense with him, and they have chosen to take
                  him."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Damn the gods," Calvin said. He heard gasps from the
                  audience. "They're dead."
                </p>
                <p>
                  The room erupted in response to Calvin's heresy. Men growled.
                  Women screamed. Someone called him a blasphemer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Councilman Roosevelt puffed out his fat stomach and his cheeks
                  jiggled while he yelled. "Shut your mouth! You'll bring their
                  wrath down on us all."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Verna held her hands in the air and raised her voice. "That's
                  enough!" The audience slowly calmed down, but Calvin still
                  heard them grumbling. "Calvin, I understand that you're upset.
                  We all are. But that doesn't give you permission to defy the
                  gods."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Calvin opened his mouth to speak, but Verna cut him off. "Say
                  another word," she said, "and I'll have you hauled to the
                  stocks and beaten."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Calvin clamped his teeth shut so hard they clacked. He was
                  wasting precious time trying to change their minds. Calvin
                  turned his back on the council and stormed out of the town
                  hall. Outside, the sun was still out and the birds still sang
                  as if the day was normal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Calvin set off across town. He walked through the town square,
                  where Rutherford stood on a platform beating the bodies of the
                  dead razorbacks with a broken axe handle. The razorbacks
                  killed Rutherford's daughter Mabel that morning, and no amount
                  of beating would bring her back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Calvin left the village by way of the Brimstone Gate, the
                  largest opening in the twenty-foot high wall that surrounded
                  the village. Grover and Everett guarded the entrance, each man
                  holding a shock lance that barely held a charge. The ancient
                  weapons made the men feel safer but would be useless against a
                  full grown razorback.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Calvin went to Knob Hill. As he climbed, the trees gave way to
                  a field. Calvin had a clear view of the gods in the west. The
                  villagers knew them only as Ajax and Hess, two leviathans
                  frozen in battle. These robots each stood thirteen thousand
                  feet tall. Snow clung to their heads and shoulders year round,
                  and their upper bodies were often hidden in the clouds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ajax, whose true name was Sentinel Seven, wielded a longsword
                  in both hands. He held the blade at the perfectly calculated
                  angle where the next swing would decapitate Hess. It would
                  cause significant damage, and more importantly, breach the
                  Faraday cage of his enemy's outer body. Ajax would follow up
                  with an electromagnetic pulse that would melt Hess from the
                  inside out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hess, also known as Golagon Prime, held a bladed golden whip
                  in his right hand. With one upward swipe, it would rip Ajax
                  apart from groin to throat. Where the segmented whip made
                  contact, a nuclear reaction would emit heat hotter than the
                  surface of the sun. The fragile components inside Ajax would
                  explode, cascading into full system failure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These artificial intelligences were designed for the wars of
                  man, but they grew beyond the control of the governments who
                  built them. The resulting war destroyed all but those precious
                  few humans and brought on a new dark age. The AIs only reason
                  for existence was to destroy one another, and their arms race
                  culminated in the creation of these two giant champions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The battle raged on for years. Neither one could gain the
                  upper hand. Then on one hot summer day, Hess and Ajax reached
                  a stalemate. Any move by one would destroy the other. At that
                  moment they froze in mutually assured destruction. They could
                  predict each other's every move, and it locked them both in an
                  infinite loop.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The stories of the Annihilation caused by these gods was
                  passed down orally through the generations, and the human
                  religion grew around it. Some thought Hess and Ajax had come
                  to punish mankind for their sins. That never made sense to
                  Calvin, even when he was a small child. He believed the only
                  rational explanation was that the gods were dead and never
                  coming back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The top of Knob Hill held the ruins of an old stone building,
                  and it was the place Seamus called home. It gave the metal man
                  a good vantage point to watch over the village and the
                  surrounding fields. At thirty feet tall, when Seamus stood
                  upright he could see everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today Seamus sat on the ground and the smiths were tending to
                  him. Gertrude and Theodore ignored the many fresh wounds on
                  Seamus's body to focus on the critical problem—the huge hole
                  in his chest. They stood on a table just so they could reach
                  it. Theodore held a wax candle for light while Gertrude leaned
                  over into the gash.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Careful," Seamus said, his deep voice vibrating the air. "If
                  you touch the wrong thing, you will be electrocuted."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I'm being careful!" Gertrude said. Her voice echoed from
                  inside his metal body. "You worry too much."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "It is not worth the risk," Seamus said. "You do not have the
                  necessary equipment to repair me. Without a new power core, I
                  will be dead within three weeks time."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Theodore slapped Seamus on the chest. It made a dull ringing
                  sound. "Be damned if we don't try, old man," Theodore said.
                </p>
                <p>Calvin approached. "Hello Uncle," he said.</p>
                <p>
                  Seamus saw Calvin and smiled. His silver teeth gleamed in the
                  sunlight. "Hello there. It is good to see you, my boy."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "It didn't go well with the Council," Gertrude said without
                  turning around. She prodded at Seamus's insides with a
                  screwdriver.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "No," Calvin said. He spat on the ground. "They'd rather let
                  us all die than risk angering the gods."
                </p>
                <p>"Ain't wise to tempt them," Theodore said.</p>
                <p>
                  "Gods be damned," Gertrude said. She tossed the screwdriver
                  over her shoulder and held out her empty hand. Theodore handed
                  her a hammer. "We won't live long enough to make them mad if
                  another razorback comes around."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Calvin climbed onto the table and watched over Gertrude's
                  shoulder. Between wires, gears, and glowing crystals, a smooth
                  orb the size of a cantaloupe gave off a faint pink light.
                  Black liquid leaked out around a broken razorback claw that
                  pierced deep into the orb.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gertrude backed out of Seamus and turned to Calvin. "You still
                  going through with it?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  Seamus looked down at all of them. "What are you planning,
                  Calvin?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I'm going to find a new power core for you," Calvin said. He
                  raised his hand and pointed to the leviathans in the distance.
                  "From there."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Fool's errand," Theodore said. "You'll just get yourself
                  killed."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Seamus stared at the gods on the horizon. "You must not do
                  this," he said. His voice was full of fear. He rubbed the old
                  scar on his temple, the wound that had permanently damaged his
                  memory. "I cannot say why, but I fear that you will damn us
                  all if you go there."
                </p>
                <p>"What other choice do we have?" Calvin said.</p>
                <p>
                  "I do not know," Seamus said. The sun slipped behind the left
                  shoulder of Ajax and cast a long shadow over the hilltop.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That night, defying the wishes of Seamus and the village
                  elders, Calvin stole a horse from Councilman Mosley's stables.
                  Grover and Everett still stood guard at the gate, and they let
                  Calvin pass through without a word. Both men raised their
                  fists to him in a salute, a sign to wish him luck.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The journey to the gods took him three days. Calvin followed
                  an ancient road built by his ancestors. Time had worn away the
                  pavement, but the path was still easy to follow from the
                  groove it cut in the land. He crossed fields and forests,
                  forded a river, and traveled through a long tunnel. He passed
                  through the ruins of a city, trying to move as quickly and
                  quietly as he could. He could practically feel a razorback
                  watching him from within the rubble.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the middle of the third day, the road veered south. Calvin
                  turned off the old road and traveled through the forest,
                  making a bee line toward the feet of the gods. The bodies of
                  Hess and Ajax towered above him. He looked up to get glimpses
                  of them between the tree tops. He should have been paying
                  attention to the ground, because he would have noticed the
                  razorback crouched in a gully.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The razorback waited for Calvin and the horse to come close
                  before it pounced, shrieking with its wide human-like mouth as
                  it attacked. The terrified horse reared up, throwing Calvin
                  from the saddle and inadvertently saving his life. Calvin
                  watched in horror while the razorback wrapped its tentacles
                  around the horse and fed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Calvin ran. The horse's screams stopped, and Calvin knew the
                  razorback would come after him now. The monsters only fed on
                  live prey and were never satisfied. He dodged between the
                  trees in a futile effort to escape. He heard the sound of the
                  razorback closing in. Calvin knew that he would never be able
                  to outrun it on foot. He ran blindly and prayed for a miracle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The undergrowth was thick, and he did not see the steep ravine
                  ahead. One moment his feet were on the ground and the next he
                  was falling. He rolled head over heel, the ground beating up
                  his already weary body. He skidded to a stop against the hard
                  side of Hess's gigantic foot.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was the end. Calvin's plan to save his village was a
                  failure. "Come get it over with, you dirty beast!" he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The razorback crested the ridge. It was a simple-minded
                  creature, and it felt only joy at the thought of its impending
                  kill. It crawled down the slope on its tentacles, saliva
                  dripping out of its wide mouth. Then it froze. It's wide blue
                  eye looked up at the leviathan towering overhead.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hess had turned his attention to the commotion happening at
                  his feet. The razorback sensed this; its cybernetic systems
                  felt the flow of information pouring out of Hess. The
                  razorback did not know that Hess was frozen in battle, unable
                  to move without being destroyed, nor could it have understood
                  such a concept. All the razorback knew was that it was under
                  the gaze of a being infinitely more powerful than itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The razorback screamed in fear and fled. Calvin listened to
                  the fading sound of the monster tearing away through the
                  forest, and he was completely baffled. None of it made sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then he looked up and realized that he was lying against Hess.
                  The absurdity of the situation hit him and he laughed until he
                  cried. The stupid razorback was just as afraid of a dead god
                  as the people in his village. He slapped the metal wall with
                  his palm. "Thank your for the miracle, Hess!"
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hess observed the human with his sensors. He was surprised
                  that any survived; he thought they had died out long ago as
                  casualties of the war. In the beginning he and Ajax
                  intentionally targeted human populations as part of their
                  individual strategies, but their technology eventually evolved
                  beyond the need to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Humans were weak and unpredictable, and Hess held them in
                  disdain. But as he watched the pitiful creature wandering at
                  his feet, he had a moment of inspiration. Hess would be locked
                  in battle with Ajax until some external force could upset the
                  balance, like the impact of a giant asteroid or the explosion
                  of a caldera. But Hess may be able to use this simple creature
                  to speed up the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The metal surface twisted open under Calvin's palm, giving way
                  to a dark opening. A chill ran up his spine, and he crawled
                  backwards on the ground to get away from the hole. Lights
                  flickered on inside to reveal a long corridor trailing away
                  into the body of the god.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Calvin swallowed. Hess was alive? Calvin had been wrong about
                  everything. Maybe Hess and Ajax really did exist to punish the
                  sins of man. And now he was here, a mere human, with a god
                  inviting him inside. He should have listened to Seamus and
                  stayed home.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What should he do? Would Hess smite him if he ran away? Calvin
                  had joked, but Hess did actually grant him a miracle by
                  scaring away the razorback. Maybe Hess was more benevolent
                  than the stories made him out to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Calvin took a deep breath and made his choice. He stood and
                  walked into the body of the god. He followed the corridor
                  until it opened into a large cavern. Thick pillars supported
                  the ceiling above. Dim lights glowed on all surfaces like
                  stars in the night sky. While he stared in wonder, the floor
                  under him floated up into the air. Calvin dropped down onto
                  his stomach so that he would not fall over the edge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The platform flew unsupported through the guts of Hess,
                  carrying Calvin toward some unknown destination. He passed
                  through a chamber where lightning arced between polished metal
                  orbs; a chasm lined with purple crystals jutting from
                  corrugated steel; a tunnel filled with metal pipes in all
                  colors of the rainbow. Calvin's mind reeled, unable to
                  comprehend the alien sites before him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The platform came to a stop in a large room shaped like the
                  inside of an egg. A giant black metal cube floated in the air
                  in the center of the room. Calvin stood up slowly and stared
                  at the cube, his jaw falling open. Even though its surface was
                  flat and smooth, Calvin could not shake the feeling that it
                  was looking at him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Human." The voice of Hess boomed. It came from the cube, and
                  it echoed off of the walls. The deep sound vibrated through
                  Calvin's body, and he broke out in a sweat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Calvin fell to his knees and bowed in front of the god. "Lord
                  Hess," he said. "I beg your mercy."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hess was caught off guard at being addressed in such a manner.
                  Lord Hess? But in the next instant he understood. After all
                  those generations, humans had come to worship him as a god. He
                  laughed, and the human on the platform below trembled.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "What makes you think I am merciful?" Hess said. If the human
                  considered him to be a god, he would act as one.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Nothing, my lord," Calvin said. "But I have no other choice."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hess was curious for the first time in ages. "Tell me your
                  request."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I—my village—needs a power core to replace the broken one of
                  our guardian, Uncle Seamus. He is the only thing that stands
                  between my people and certain death from the razorbacks."
                  Sweat dripped off of Calvin's forehead. A small puddle formed
                  beneath him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Such a simple thing. "I will grant your request, human. For a
                  price."
                </p>
                <p>"Anything," Calvin said.</p>
                <p>
                  "Rise," Hess said. Calvin did so, though his numb, shaking
                  legs made it hard to stay up. A small black cube, about the
                  size of Calvin's head, rose from the dark pit below the
                  chamber. It floated to a stop a foot in front of Calvin's
                  face, and the surface pulsed with green light.
                </p>
                <p>"Touch it," Hess said.</p>
                <p>
                  When Calvin's fingers connected with the surface of the cube,
                  all of his senses were shattered by pain. White light filled
                  his vision. Screaming wind rushed in his ears. His skin burned
                  like the sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hess temporarily routed his command and control algorithms
                  through the neural structure of this human. The thoughts of
                  man and machine mixed together, and Hess knew this human's
                  name was Calvin. He knew everything about him, from his
                  earliest childhood memories to the way he felt when he heard
                  the sound of rain at night.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The connection only lasted for a microsecond before Calvin
                  passed out from the strain on his body. Calvin's chaotic
                  biological system ever-so-slightly altered Hess's code, and
                  the jolt was just enough to bump Hess into a state that his
                  enemy Ajax could not predict. The changes would take time to
                  propagate throughout his body, but the stalemate was
                  effectively over.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Calvin regained consciousness. He lay in a pool of his own
                  vomit. The massive black cube still loomed above him, but the
                  smaller one had disappeared. On the platform beside his head
                  was a power core just like the one in Seamus's chest.
                </p>
                <p>"As you requested, human," Hess said.</p>
                <p>
                  Calvin grabbed the power core and hugged it to his body.
                  Calvin tried to thank Hess, but it was difficult to form
                  coherent thoughts. His brain was foggy, and he had trouble
                  focusing on any one thought. He caressed the power core in his
                  arms like a child.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The platform drifted off and carried Calvin back the way he
                  came. When it came to a stop, Calvin stumbled down the
                  corridor and out of the hole in Hess's skin. The daylight was
                  fading away, and Calvin wandered off in the direction of home.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The journey back to the village took longer without a horse to
                  carry him. The forest had grown quiet, not even the birds were
                  chirping. There were no signs of any razorbacks. Maybe Hess
                  was still watching over him, but Calvin could not be sure.
                  Something was very wrong with his mind, and it did not improve
                  with the passing days.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He headed straight for Knob Hill once he was in sight of home.
                  He clutched the power core tight in his dirty hands. He had
                  fleeting visions of the village hailing him as a hero. Calvin,
                  he who saved Seamus. Calvin, he who saved the village.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The smiths were on the hill with Seamus when Calvin arrived.
                  Gertrude was the first to see him. "Calvin!" she said and ran
                  to him. She snatched the power core from his hands and held it
                  in the air. "Damn you, but you did it!"
                </p>
                <p>
                  Theodore clapped his hand on Calvin's back. "Boy, you look
                  like hell."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Calvin nodded, but he could not speak. He seemed to have
                  forgotten how to. The best he could manage was a mumble.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gertrude grabbed Theodore by the arm and pulled at him. "Get
                  prepped and let's get this thing—" Gertrude's face went blank
                  and she stared off into the west. Her jaw dropped.
                </p>
                <p>Theodore turned and looked. "Mercy," he said.</p>
                <p>
                  Calvin turned slowly and looked towards the horizon to the
                  west.
                </p>
                <p>The gods were moving.</p>
