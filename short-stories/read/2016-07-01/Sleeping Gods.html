The
		Great Annihilation that destroyed almost all of their civilization was remembered only as a
		myth, and the giant robotic leviathans frozen mid-battle in the distance were worshipped by them
		as angry gods. Calvin was born and raised into this harsh life, but he had dreams of being
		something more. Little did he know that his choices would restart an ancient war.</p> <p class="mb-4">On a warm summer afternoon, Calvin stood in front of the seven-member council of elders. The
		chamber hall was packed, and all eyes were on him. &quot;You&#39;re just going to let him die?&quot; Calvin
		said. His face was red with anger.</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;There&#39;s nothing else we can do, boy,&quot; Councilwoman Verna said in her always condescending tone.
		Though Calvin was in his early twenties, he had no children and was thus not considered a man.</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;Uncle Seamus wouldn&#39;t give up on us if we were hurt,&quot; Calvin said.</p> <p class="mb-4">The Tetra Nova Silver-Series Humanoid War Machine<b>™</b>
		—known only as Uncle Seamus to the humans—was the protector of Stonekeep village. He sustained a
		severe injury from a laser cannon during the Annihilation, which damaged over seventy-five percent
		of his memory circuits. Through a series of coincidences, the malfunctioning robot found himself
		guarding a group of grade-school children whose parents were all dead.</p> <p class="mb-4">The two battling artificial intelligences entered a stalemate, and the war seemed to end. Seamus
		continued protecting those children against the remnants of war, particularly the cybernetic
		death machines known as razorbacks that were designed to kill man and machine alike. Many of
		those children survived into adulthood and had children of their own. This continued generation
		after generation, though Seamus could not track time with his broken memory.</p> <p class="mb-4">After hundreds of years of relative success, luck ran out for Seamus. Earlier that same morning,
		a razorback attacked a group of villagers tending the cornfield. Seamus descended from his
		lookout spot on Knob Hill, his ten foot tall legs covering the distance faster than any horse
		could run. He fought the razorback brilliantly, easily dodging its many clawed tentacles and
		pounding its one-eyed torso with his massive fists. Sadly, he did not see the second razorback
		hiding in the corn stalks.</p> <p class="mb-4">Verna shook her head and spoke like she would to a small child. &quot;Seamus has reached the end of
		his journey, Calvin. The gods have taken offense with him, and they have chosen to take him.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;Damn the gods,&quot; Calvin said. He heard gasps from the audience. &quot;They&#39;re dead.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">The room erupted in response to Calvin&#39;s heresy. Men growled. Women screamed. Someone called him
		a blasphemer.</p> <p class="mb-4">Councilman Roosevelt puffed out his fat stomach and his cheeks jiggled while he yelled. &quot;Shut
		your mouth! You&#39;ll bring their wrath down on us all.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">Verna held her hands in the air and raised her voice. &quot;That&#39;s enough!&quot; The audience slowly
		calmed down, but Calvin still heard them grumbling. &quot;Calvin, I understand that you&#39;re upset. We
		all are. But that doesn&#39;t give you permission to defy the gods.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">Calvin opened his mouth to speak, but Verna cut him off. &quot;Say another word,&quot; she said, &quot;and I&#39;ll
		have you hauled to the stocks and beaten.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">Calvin clamped his teeth shut so hard they clacked. He was wasting precious time trying to
		change their minds. Calvin turned his back on the council and stormed out of the town hall.
		Outside, the sun was still out and the birds still sang as if the day was normal.</p> <p class="mb-4">Calvin set off across town. He walked through the town square, where Rutherford stood on a
		platform beating the bodies of the dead razorbacks with a broken axe handle. The razorbacks
		killed Rutherford&#39;s daughter Mabel that morning, and no amount of beating would bring her back.</p> <p class="mb-4">Calvin left the village by way of the Brimstone Gate, the largest opening in the twenty-foot
		high wall that surrounded the village. Grover and Everett guarded the entrance, each man holding
		a shock lance that barely held a charge. The ancient weapons made the men feel safer but would
		be useless against a full grown razorback.</p> <p class="mb-4">Calvin went to Knob Hill. As he climbed, the trees gave way to a field. Calvin had a clear view
		of the gods in the west. The villagers knew them only as Ajax and Hess, two leviathans frozen in
		battle. These robots each stood thirteen thousand feet tall. Snow clung to their heads and
		shoulders year round, and their upper bodies were often hidden in the clouds.</p> <p class="mb-4">Ajax, whose true name was Sentinel Seven, wielded a longsword in both hands. He held the blade
		at the perfectly calculated angle where the next swing would decapitate Hess. It would cause
		significant damage, and more importantly, breach the Faraday cage of his enemy&#39;s outer body.
		Ajax would follow up with an electromagnetic pulse that would melt Hess from the inside out.</p> <p class="mb-4">Hess, also known as Golagon Prime, held a bladed golden whip in his right hand. With one upward
		swipe, it would rip Ajax apart from groin to throat. Where the segmented whip made contact, a
		nuclear reaction would emit heat hotter than the surface of the sun. The fragile components
		inside Ajax would explode, cascading into full system failure.</p> <p class="mb-4">These artificial intelligences were designed for the wars of man, but they grew beyond the
		control of the governments who built them. The resulting war destroyed all but those precious
		few humans and brought on a new dark age. The AIs only reason for existence was to destroy one
		another, and their arms race culminated in the creation of these two giant champions.</p> <p class="mb-4">The battle raged on for years. Neither one could gain the upper hand. Then on one hot summer
		day, Hess and Ajax reached a stalemate. Any move by one would destroy the other. At that moment
		they froze in mutually assured destruction. They could predict each other&#39;s every move, and it
		locked them both in an infinite loop.</p> <p class="mb-4">The stories of the Annihilation caused by these gods was passed down orally through the
		generations, and the human religion grew around it. Some thought Hess and Ajax had come to
		punish mankind for their sins. That never made sense to Calvin, even when he was a small child.
		He believed the only rational explanation was that the gods were dead and never coming back.</p> <p class="mb-4">The top of Knob Hill held the ruins of an old stone building, and it was the place Seamus called
		home. It gave the metal man a good vantage point to watch over the village and the surrounding
		fields. At thirty feet tall, when Seamus stood upright he could see everything.</p> <p class="mb-4">Today Seamus sat on the ground and the smiths were tending to him. Gertrude and Theodore ignored
		the many fresh wounds on Seamus&#39;s body to focus on the critical problem—the huge hole in his
		chest. They stood on a table just so they could reach it. Theodore held a wax candle for light
		while Gertrude leaned over into the gash.</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;Careful,&quot; Seamus said, his deep voice vibrating the air. &quot;If you touch the wrong thing, you
		will be electrocuted.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;I&#39;m being careful!&quot; Gertrude said. Her voice echoed from inside his metal body. &quot;You worry too
		much.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;It is not worth the risk,&quot; Seamus said. &quot;You do not have the necessary equipment to repair me.
		Without a new power core, I will be dead within three weeks time.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">Theodore slapped Seamus on the chest. It made a dull ringing sound. &quot;Be damned if we don&#39;t try,
		old man,&quot; Theodore said.</p> <p class="mb-4">Calvin approached. &quot;Hello Uncle,&quot; he said.</p> <p class="mb-4">Seamus saw Calvin and smiled. His silver teeth gleamed in the sunlight. &quot;Hello there. It is good
		to see you, my boy.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;It didn&#39;t go well with the Council,&quot; Gertrude said without turning around. She prodded at
		Seamus&#39;s insides with a screwdriver.</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;No,&quot; Calvin said. He spat on the ground. &quot;They&#39;d rather let us all die than risk angering the
		gods.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;Ain&#39;t wise to tempt them,&quot; Theodore said.</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;Gods be damned,&quot; Gertrude said. She tossed the screwdriver over her shoulder and held out her
		empty hand. Theodore handed her a hammer. &quot;We won&#39;t live long enough to make them mad if another
		razorback comes around.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">Calvin climbed onto the table and watched over Gertrude&#39;s shoulder. Between wires, gears, and
		glowing crystals, a smooth orb the size of a cantaloupe gave off a faint pink light. Black
		liquid leaked out around a broken razorback claw that pierced deep into the orb.</p> <p class="mb-4">Gertrude backed out of Seamus and turned to Calvin. &quot;You still going through with it?&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">Seamus looked down at all of them. &quot;What are you planning, Calvin?&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;I&#39;m going to find a new power core for you,&quot; Calvin said. He raised his hand and pointed to the
		leviathans in the distance. &quot;From there.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;Fool&#39;s errand,&quot; Theodore said. &quot;You&#39;ll just get yourself killed.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">Seamus stared at the gods on the horizon. &quot;You must not do this,&quot; he said. His voice was full of
		fear. He rubbed the old scar on his temple, the wound that had permanently damaged his memory.
		&quot;I cannot say why, but I fear that you will damn us all if you go there.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;What other choice do we have?&quot; Calvin said.</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;I do not know,&quot; Seamus said. The sun slipped behind the left shoulder of Ajax and cast a long
		shadow over the hilltop.</p> <p class="mb-4">That night, defying the wishes of Seamus and the village elders, Calvin stole a horse from
		Councilman Mosley&#39;s stables. Grover and Everett still stood guard at the gate, and they let
		Calvin pass through without a word. Both men raised their fists to him in a salute, a sign to
		wish him luck.</p> <p class="mb-4">The journey to the gods took him three days. Calvin followed an ancient road built by his
		ancestors. Time had worn away the pavement, but the path was still easy to follow from the
		groove it cut in the land. He crossed fields and forests, forded a river, and traveled through a
		long tunnel. He passed through the ruins of a city, trying to move as quickly and quietly as he
		could. He could practically feel a razorback watching him from within the rubble.</p> <p class="mb-4">By the middle of the third day, the road veered south. Calvin turned off the old road and
		traveled through the forest, making a bee line toward the feet of the gods. The bodies of Hess
		and Ajax towered above him. He looked up to get glimpses of them between the tree tops. He
		should have been paying attention to the ground, because he would have noticed the razorback
		crouched in a gully.</p> <p class="mb-4">The razorback waited for Calvin and the horse to come close before it pounced, shrieking with
		its wide human-like mouth as it attacked. The terrified horse reared up, throwing Calvin from
		the saddle and inadvertently saving his life. Calvin watched in horror while the razorback
		wrapped its tentacles around the horse and fed.</p> <p class="mb-4">Calvin ran. The horse&#39;s screams stopped, and Calvin knew the razorback would come after him now.
		The monsters only fed on live prey and were never satisfied. He dodged between the trees in a
		futile effort to escape. He heard the sound of the razorback closing in. Calvin knew that he
		would never be able to outrun it on foot. He ran blindly and prayed for a miracle.</p> <p class="mb-4">The undergrowth was thick, and he did not see the steep ravine ahead. One moment his feet were
		on the ground and the next he was falling. He rolled head over heel, the ground beating up his
		already weary body. He skidded to a stop against the hard side of Hess&#39;s gigantic foot.</p> <p class="mb-4">This was the end. Calvin&#39;s plan to save his village was a failure. &quot;Come get it over with, you
		dirty beast!&quot; he said.</p> <p class="mb-4">The razorback crested the ridge. It was a simple-minded creature, and it felt only joy at the
		thought of its impending kill. It crawled down the slope on its tentacles, saliva dripping out
		of its wide mouth. Then it froze. It&#39;s wide blue eye looked up at the leviathan towering
		overhead.</p> <p class="mb-4">Hess had turned his attention to the commotion happening at his feet. The razorback sensed this;
		its cybernetic systems felt the flow of information pouring out of Hess. The razorback did not
		know that Hess was frozen in battle, unable to move without being destroyed, nor could it have
		understood such a concept. All the razorback knew was that it was under the gaze of a being
		infinitely more powerful than itself.</p> <p class="mb-4">The razorback screamed in fear and fled. Calvin listened to the fading sound of the monster
		tearing away through the forest, and he was completely baffled. None of it made sense.</p> <p class="mb-4">Then he looked up and realized that he was lying against Hess. The absurdity of the situation
		hit him and he laughed until he cried. The stupid razorback was just as afraid of a dead god as
		the people in his village. He slapped the metal wall with his palm. &quot;Thank your for the miracle,
		Hess!&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">Hess observed the human with his sensors. He was surprised that any survived; he thought they
		had died out long ago as casualties of the war. In the beginning he and Ajax intentionally
		targeted human populations as part of their individual strategies, but their technology
		eventually evolved beyond the need to do so.</p> <p class="mb-4">Humans were weak and unpredictable, and Hess held them in disdain. But as he watched the pitiful
		creature wandering at his feet, he had a moment of inspiration. Hess would be locked in battle
		with Ajax until some external force could upset the balance, like the impact of a giant asteroid
		or the explosion of a caldera. But Hess may be able to use this simple creature to speed up the
		process.</p> <p class="mb-4">The metal surface twisted open under Calvin&#39;s palm, giving way to a dark opening. A chill ran up
		his spine, and he crawled backwards on the ground to get away from the hole. Lights flickered on
		inside to reveal a long corridor trailing away into the body of the god.</p> <p class="mb-4">Calvin swallowed. Hess was alive? Calvin had been wrong about everything. Maybe Hess and Ajax
		really did exist to punish the sins of man. And now he was here, a mere human, with a god
		inviting him inside. He should have listened to Seamus and stayed home.</p> <p class="mb-4">What should he do? Would Hess smite him if he ran away? Calvin had joked, but Hess did actually
		grant him a miracle by scaring away the razorback. Maybe Hess was more benevolent than the
		stories made him out to be.</p> <p class="mb-4">Calvin took a deep breath and made his choice. He stood and walked into the body of the god. He
		followed the corridor until it opened into a large cavern. Thick pillars supported the ceiling
		above. Dim lights glowed on all surfaces like stars in the night sky. While he stared in wonder,
		the floor under him floated up into the air. Calvin dropped down onto his stomach so that he
		would not fall over the edge.</p> <p class="mb-4">The platform flew unsupported through the guts of Hess, carrying Calvin toward some unknown
		destination. He passed through a chamber where lightning arced between polished metal orbs; a
		chasm lined with purple crystals jutting from corrugated steel; a tunnel filled with metal pipes
		in all colors of the rainbow. Calvin&#39;s mind reeled, unable to comprehend the alien sites before
		him.</p> <p class="mb-4">The platform came to a stop in a large room shaped like the inside of an egg. A giant black
		metal cube floated in the air in the center of the room. Calvin stood up slowly and stared at
		the cube, his jaw falling open. Even though its surface was flat and smooth, Calvin could not
		shake the feeling that it was looking at him.</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;Human.&quot; The voice of Hess boomed. It came from the cube, and it echoed off of the walls. The
		deep sound vibrated through Calvin&#39;s body, and he broke out in a sweat.</p> <p class="mb-4">Calvin fell to his knees and bowed in front of the god. &quot;Lord Hess,&quot; he said. &quot;I beg your
		mercy.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">Hess was caught off guard at being addressed in such a manner. Lord Hess? But in the next
		instant he understood. After all those generations, humans had come to worship him as a god. He
		laughed, and the human on the platform below trembled.</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;What makes you think I am merciful?&quot; Hess said. If the human considered him to be a god, he
		would act as one.</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;Nothing, my lord,&quot; Calvin said. &quot;But I have no other choice.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">Hess was curious for the first time in ages. &quot;Tell me your request.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;I—my village—needs a power core to replace the broken one of our guardian, Uncle Seamus. He is
		the only thing that stands between my people and certain death from the razorbacks.&quot; Sweat
		dripped off of Calvin&#39;s forehead. A small puddle formed beneath him.</p> <p class="mb-4">Such a simple thing. &quot;I will grant your request, human. For a price.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;Anything,&quot; Calvin said.</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;Rise,&quot; Hess said. Calvin did so, though his numb, shaking legs made it hard to stay up. A small
		black cube, about the size of Calvin&#39;s head, rose from the dark pit below the chamber. It
		floated to a stop a foot in front of Calvin&#39;s face, and the surface pulsed with green light.</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;Touch it,&quot; Hess said.</p> <p class="mb-4">When Calvin&#39;s fingers connected with the surface of the cube, all of his senses were shattered
		by pain. White light filled his vision. Screaming wind rushed in his ears. His skin burned like
		the sun.</p> <p class="mb-4">Hess temporarily routed his command and control algorithms through the neural structure of this
		human. The thoughts of man and machine mixed together, and Hess knew this human&#39;s name was
		Calvin. He knew everything about him, from his earliest childhood memories to the way he felt
		when he heard the sound of rain at night.</p> <p class="mb-4">The connection only lasted for a microsecond before Calvin passed out from the strain on his
		body. Calvin&#39;s chaotic biological system ever-so-slightly altered Hess&#39;s code, and the jolt was
		just enough to bump Hess into a state that his enemy Ajax could not predict. The changes would
		take time to propagate throughout his body, but the stalemate was effectively over.</p> <p class="mb-4">Calvin regained consciousness. He lay in a pool of his own vomit. The massive black cube still
		loomed above him, but the smaller one had disappeared. On the platform beside his head was a
		power core just like the one in Seamus&#39;s chest.</p> <p class="mb-4">&quot;As you requested, human,&quot; Hess said.</p> <p class="mb-4">Calvin grabbed the power core and hugged it to his body. Calvin tried to thank Hess, but it was
		difficult to form coherent thoughts. His brain was foggy, and he had trouble focusing on any one
		thought. He caressed the power core in his arms like a child.</p> <p class="mb-4">The platform drifted off and carried Calvin back the way he came. When it came to a stop, Calvin
		stumbled down the corridor and out of the hole in Hess&#39;s skin. The daylight was fading away, and
		Calvin wandered off in the direction of home.</p> <p class="mb-4">The journey back to the village took longer without a horse to carry him. The forest had grown
		quiet, not even the birds were chirping. There were no signs of any razorbacks. Maybe Hess was
		still watching over him, but Calvin could not be sure. Something was very wrong with his mind,
		and it did not improve with the passing days.</p> <p class="mb-4">He headed straight for Knob Hill once he was in sight of home. He clutched the power core tight
		in his dirty hands. He had fleeting visions of the village hailing him as a hero. Calvin, he who
		saved Seamus. Calvin, he who saved the village.</p> <p class="mb-4">The smiths were on the hill with Seamus when Calvin arrived. Gertrude was the first to see him.
		&quot;Calvin!&quot; she said and ran to him. She snatched the power core from his hands and held it in the
		air. &quot;Damn you, but you did it!&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">Theodore clapped his hand on Calvin&#39;s back. &quot;Boy, you look like hell.&quot;</p> <p class="mb-4">Calvin nodded, but he could not speak. He seemed to have forgotten how to. The best he could
		manage was a mumble.</p> <p class="mb-4">Gertrude grabbed Theodore by the arm and pulled at him. &quot;Get prepped and let&#39;s get this thing—&quot;
		Gertrude&#39;s face went blank and she stared off into the west. Her jaw dropped.</p> <p class="mb-4">Theodore turned and looked. &quot;Mercy,&quot; he said.</p> <p class="mb-4">Calvin turned slowly and looked towards the horizon to the west.</p> <p class="mb-4">The gods were moving.</p></span></div> <span class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-center my-4"><hr class="w-1/2 !border-t-2"></span>  <ul class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-center"> <li><a href="/" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Home</span></a> </li><li class="mx-1 hidden sm:flex" data-svelte-h="svelte-13pvle1">|</li> <li><a href="/books" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Books</span></a> </li><li class="mx-1 hidden sm:flex" data-svelte-h="svelte-13pvle1">|</li> <li><a href="/short-stories" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Stories</span></a> </li><li class="mx-1 hidden sm:flex" data-svelte-h="svelte-13pvle1">|</li> <li><a href="/games" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Games</span></a> </li><li class="mx-1 hidden sm:flex" data-svelte-h="svelte-13pvle1">|</li> <li><a href="/software" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Software</span></a> </li></ul> <ul class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-center mt-4"> <li><a href="/legal" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Legal</span></a> </li><li class="mx-1 hidden sm:flex" data-svelte-h="svelte-13pvle1">|</li> <li><a href="/about" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">About</span></a> </li></ul> <span class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-center my-4"><hr class="w-1/2 !border-t-2"></span> <span class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-center"><a class="hover:underline" href="mailto:contact@evilglasses.com" data-svelte-h="svelte-1r4kvog"><span class="fa-solid fa-envelope mr-1.5"></span>
