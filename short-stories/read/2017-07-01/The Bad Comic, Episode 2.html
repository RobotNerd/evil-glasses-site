Be funny. Say something clever. At least make fun of someone for fuck&#39;s
		sake. No? Why the hell not? Just make fun of that girl&#39;s leggings. They are ugly. Say something
		like “I hope she didn&#39;t pay for those.” I know it isn&#39;t funny. Jesus Christ. But it&#39;s something.
		Get over yourself and say something.</p> <br> <p class="mb-4">I hadn&#39;t had a contract come through for weeks. I was doing busy work. Organizing files, looking
		at new document management software, standardizing clauses, or wasting the Wi-Fi by watching
		Netflix and YouTube.</p> <p class="mb-4">I hadn&#39;t been to a comedy club in months. After I got some laughs with the few okay jokes I
		wrote, I ran dry. I watched every comedy special I could but hated most of them.</p> <p class="mb-4">I think I&#39;m over comedy. I don&#39;t think I like it anymore.</p> <br> <p class="mb-4">Colleen carried two clear drinks back to the table we were sitting at.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Happy hour is over in 30 minutes,” she said.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Shit,” I got up once she put her drinks down. “I&#39;ll get two more.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“This one is for you.” She was confused.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Ah,” I brushed away her words, “Just in case it gets slammed and we don&#39;t make it back to the
		bar before it&#39;s over.”</p> <p class="mb-4">It was hard hanging out with people. They wanted to talk about what they were doing and then ask
		how I was doing. I didn&#39;t want to tell them.</p> <p class="mb-4">Two drinks. Drink these two drinks and you can leave. Go home, sit in front of your stupid
		notebook and write nothing. Nice, productive night. Alone.</p> <p class="mb-4">I got my drinks and sat back with Colleen.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Have you heard from Rhett?” she asked.</p> <p class="mb-4">I hung my head. “God damn, Colleen. How about, how was my weekend?”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Oh, how was your weekend?” She took a sip from her drink and smiled at me.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Shitty and boring.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“What did you do?”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Nothing. What did you do?”</p> <p class="mb-4">“It&#39;s impossible to do nothing. When I was a kid my Uncle would call and when I would answer he
		would ask &#39;What are you doing?&#39; I would say &#39;Nothing&#39; and he would tell me, &#39;You can&#39;t do
		nothing.&#39; So I always tell him, and anyone else, what I&#39;m doing.”</p> <p class="mb-4">She looked at me waiting for me to tell her what I did over the weekend. “Jerked off and drank,”
		I said.</p> <p class="mb-4">“See, that&#39;s not nothing.”</p> <p class="mb-4">I smiled reluctantly. “What did you do this weekend?” I asked again.</p> <p class="mb-4">“I went out with that guy I had been messaging.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Oh, yeah. Was he everything his charming messages suggested?”</p> <p class="mb-4">She pursed her lips and looked past me. “He was one of the biggest jerks I have met in this
		city.”</p> <p class="mb-4">Her eyes glassed over with tears. I figured as much, though.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Hey, hey.” I reached over and patted her on the shoulder. “There are millions of people here.
		There will be another.” I looked around. “Like that guy!”</p> <p class="mb-4">She looked at the chubby, balding guy with a neck beard that I was pointing to. She looked back
		to me with a blank look on her face.</p> <p class="mb-4">“You really aren&#39;t funny,” she told me.</p> <br> <p class="mb-4">Are jokes about not being funny, funny? Are jokes about not being able to make something funny,
		funny? Are jokes about trying to be funny but not being funny, funny?</p> <p class="mb-4">No and they never will be.</p> <p class="mb-4">Self-deprecation could be funny. I suck, I&#39;m bad at this. I haven&#39;t written a joke in months. I
		barely even have a handful of good jokes. And that&#39;s my set, good night everyone. Thanks for
		coming. Tip your bartender. Who doesn&#39;t tip the bartender, anyway? I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen
		anyone stiff a bartender.</p> <p class="mb-4">Why the fuck do people say that?</p> <p class="mb-4">That&#39;s a stupid joke. Fuck the guy that got away with saying that and having some stupid asshole
		chuckle.</p> <br> <p class="mb-4">I sat at my desk clicking around on Netflix when an email from Rhett came in. I didn&#39;t open it
		right away. I didn&#39;t want to seem like I had nothing better to do than read any email I got
		right away, no matter who it was from.</p> <p class="mb-4">I picked a British crime drama and went to the email. I was only cc&#39;d on it. It was just an FYI
		about something that could happen, just in case it needed a contract. Waste of my damn time.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Steph!” Colleen leaned into my office.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Hey.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“I have a date tonight.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“See, there&#39;s a million people to date here.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“I know,” she smiled and twisted her torso back and forth. “You were right.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Where are you guys going?”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Were getting drinks at Pier 99 and then dinner somewhere if it all goes well.”</p> <p class="mb-4">I sarcastically smiled for her. “Very cool.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Thanks.” She stayed in my office looking at my whiteboard. There was only a list of music to
		listen to on it. “I&#39;m going to keep asking you about him. You should just tell me what happened
		with Rhett.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Bye, Colleen. Have fun on your date. I hope you two have beautiful kids.” I put my ear buds in
		and clicked my mouse loudly and banged on my keyboard.</p> <p class="mb-4">She smiled and waved as she left. I shook my head, rolled my eyes, and sighed. The trifecta.</p> <br> <p class="mb-4">The thing that upsets me when people ask me about Rhett is that I know for certain he&#39;s not
		anything like what I made him out to be. He wasn&#39;t even the type of person everyone else thought
		he was.</p> <p class="mb-4">We worked it out that he would come visit for a weekend. We went out, had fun, came back to my
		place, had sex, drank coffee in the morning, and then he left early.</p> <p class="mb-4">I messaged him too many times and got no response to most of them until he stopped all together.
		The last message he sent me was, “Don&#39;t tell anyone about us. It was a one time thing.”</p> <br> <p class="mb-4">It feels like I&#39;m mad at him, furious that that&#39;s all he ended up being, but I know I&#39;m mad at
		myself. I didn&#39;t need to make him what he wasn&#39;t, the perfect man and the only person on the
		planet that could make me happy.</p> <p class="mb-4">And when I think about being funny I think about that night and how hopeful and happy I was and
		I don&#39;t want to be funny anymore.</p> <p class="mb-4">That&#39;s what happened with Rhett.</p> <br> <p class="mb-4">Colleen and I were out after work. She was talking about the guy she was dating now, how great
		he was and how she hoped he&#39;s the one.</p> <p class="mb-4">“How can you hope someone is the one?” I asked.</p> <p class="mb-4">“I just want him to be the one, then.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“He either will be or he won&#39;t be. You can&#39;t make people be the one.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“But we can grow into it.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Isn&#39;t that something you both are supposed to feel right off the bat?”</p> <p class="mb-4">She smiled, “Maybe we did and we just aren&#39;t telling each other yet.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“You better tell him soon.” I finished my drink and looked for the waiter.</p> <p class="mb-4">“I&#39;m not worried about it, for once.”</p> <p class="mb-4">Her optimism was tiring.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Let&#39;s talk about something different,” I said.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Okay. Did you hear the diss track Tanya la Tigre put out yesterday?”</p> <p class="mb-4">I smiled hoping this would be a good distraction. “No, sounds like a fake name, and tell me
		everything about it.”</p> <br> <p class="mb-4">I know I&#39;ll get over Rhett. But I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever be funny.</p></span></div> <span class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-center my-4"><hr class="w-1/2 !border-t-2"></span>  <ul class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-center"> <li><a href="/" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Home</span></a> </li><li class="mx-1 hidden sm:flex" data-svelte-h="svelte-13pvle1">|</li> <li><a href="/books" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Books</span></a> </li><li class="mx-1 hidden sm:flex" data-svelte-h="svelte-13pvle1">|</li> <li><a href="/short-stories" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Stories</span></a> </li><li class="mx-1 hidden sm:flex" data-svelte-h="svelte-13pvle1">|</li> <li><a href="/games" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Games</span></a> </li><li class="mx-1 hidden sm:flex" data-svelte-h="svelte-13pvle1">|</li> <li><a href="/software" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Software</span></a> </li></ul> <ul class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-center mt-4"> <li><a href="/legal" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Legal</span></a> </li><li class="mx-1 hidden sm:flex" data-svelte-h="svelte-13pvle1">|</li> <li><a href="/about" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">About</span></a> </li></ul> <span class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-center my-4"><hr class="w-1/2 !border-t-2"></span> <span class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-center"><a class="hover:underline" href="mailto:contact@evilglasses.com" data-svelte-h="svelte-1r4kvog"><span class="fa-solid fa-envelope mr-1.5"></span>
