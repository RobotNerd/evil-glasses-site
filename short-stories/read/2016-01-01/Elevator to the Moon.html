class="h2 mb-1 sm:h1 sm:mb-4">Elevator to the Moon</h1> <h3 class="h4 mb-8 sm:h3">by Sara Lufrano</h3> <p class="mb-4">“Just the two of us,” he said to her.</p> <p class="mb-4">She barely smiled while looking at the floor holding her small tote bag.</p> <p class="mb-4">“I&#39;m Paul.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Hello, I&#39;m Julia.”</p> <p class="mb-4">They didn&#39;t shake hands.</p> <p class="mb-4">He stood in one of the two back corners and she stood in the other. Both looked out of the only
		porthole as the earth moved further away.</p> <p class="mb-4">“This is weird right?” Paul asked with a smile.</p> <p class="mb-4">She shrugged her shoulders and shook her head.</p> <p class="mb-4">“You&#39;re very beautiful.”</p> <p class="mb-4">She turned her head away from him but blushed.</p> <p class="mb-4">“You know that though, right? You must get that all the time. It is true.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Thank you,” she said.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Women often think that I&#39;m handsome.” He smiled at her even though she wasn&#39;t looking at him.</p> <p class="mb-4">She nodded.</p> <p class="mb-4">“I really wish you&#39;d talk to me. This is such a long trip.”</p> <p class="mb-4">He took the two steps to the porthole to watch the earth. “Come look.” He urged her over.</p> <p class="mb-4">She went to his side and looked out. There it was, Earth. Moving away form them as they ascended
		to the moon.</p> <p class="mb-4">“It&#39;s marvelous,” she said.</p> <p class="mb-4">He watched the earth and she looked at him from the corner of her eye. He was very handsome,
		tall, muscular.</p> <p class="mb-4">“You—you are handsome,” she said looking out of the porthole.</p> <p class="mb-4">He smiled. “I know.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Why are you going to the moon?” she said.</p> <p class="mb-4">Paul sighed and ran his hand through his hair. “Earth isn&#39;t kind to everyone.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“I&#39;m sorry to hear that.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“It&#39;s not your fault. I&#39;m sure if I knew you there I could have stayed.”</p> <p class="mb-4">Julia went back to her space and put down her tote. The elevator they were in had black walls,
		black rubber floor, stainless steal trim. The porthole was the only thing that let them know
		they weren&#39;t simply going to the top floor of a tall building.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Hopefully it&#39;s better for the both of us.” She crossed her arms over her chest. “Are you
		feeling fine?” She asked him.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Yeah.” He turned and looked at her.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Oh.” She took a deep breath. “I think my body is reacting to the travel shot.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Is there anything I can do?” He stood in front of her now.</p> <p class="mb-4">“I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m sure I couldn&#39;t throw up even if I had to.”</p> <p class="mb-4">The traveling shot they both received retarded their body functions to trick them into feeling
		like a few hours had passed instead of the three days. They couldn&#39;t eat, sleep, use the
		restroom.</p> <p class="mb-4">“I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll feel better soon,” he said.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Thank you.” She looked at him. He was smiling at her and she smiled back.</p> <p class="mb-4">They stayed quiet for a while. He started to hum and she looked out the porthole. Now there were
		only stars.</p> <p class="mb-4">“They&#39;re so unfamiliar,” she said.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Hmm?”</p> <p class="mb-4">“The stars. I don&#39;t recognize anything.”</p> <p class="mb-4">He stood next to her and looked. “Yeah.” He looked at her. He reached out with his hand and
		turned her face toward him. She looked at him now. He kissed her softly but completely without
		question. She didn&#39;t kiss back.</p> <p class="mb-4">“I—I am married,” Julia said.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Oh.” Paul gave a small smile.</p> <p class="mb-4">“My husband is on the moon. I&#39;m going up to be with him.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“He&#39;s a lucky man.” He stepped back from her and leaned against the same corner of the elevator
		that they began their journey.</p> <p class="mb-4">She looked at the stars again. “He&#39;s been there for three years.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“What&#39;s he do?”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Air chemical engineer.”</p> <p class="mb-4">Paul laughed. “Someone we all need.”</p> <p class="mb-4">She nodded. A bit later she went back to her original corner. He started to hum again and slid
		down to sit on the floor, legs out in front of him. She went over to him, squatted down and
		kissed him.</p> <p class="mb-4">He didn&#39;t kiss back.</p> <p class="mb-4">She pulled away and looked in his eyes.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Are you done?” he asked.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Uh.” She was startled. “Yes.”</p> <p class="mb-4">She stood and went back.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Why did you do that?” he asked.</p> <p class="mb-4">“I guess I didn&#39;t mind you kissing me.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“You&#39;re married.”</p> <p class="mb-4">She nodded.</p> <p class="mb-4">He stood up and turned his body to her but leaned against the wall.</p> <p class="mb-4">“It&#39;s only unfortunate for me that you&#39;re married,” he said.</p> <p class="mb-4">She shook her head without looking at him. “No, not just you.”</p> <p class="mb-4">Paul reached out and took her hand. She looked at him. He kissed her and she kissed back. His
		hands moved deftly around her body and under her clothes. She moaned and pulled her body against
		his. They kissed sloppily and rushed, they breathed into each other&#39;s ears and necks. Soon they
		were both exposed and he was inside her.</p> <p class="mb-4">He finished and slumped down next to her. She moved to nestle her head on his shoulder. He
		smiled and stood up before she could settle.</p> <p class="mb-4">She propped herself up and watched him dress. He smiled at her.</p> <p class="mb-4">“You&#39;re beautiful,” he said.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Thanks. That was great,” she said.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Yeah.”</p> <p class="mb-4">He stretched a bit and stood in his corner. She got up and gathered her clothes and dressed. She
		stood in her corner.</p> <p class="mb-4">“What are you going to do once you get there?” she asked.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Find a job.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“What did you do on Earth?”</p> <p class="mb-4">“It doesn&#39;t matter.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Oh. I won&#39;t say anything bad about it.”</p> <p class="mb-4">He looked at her with a plain face, and then smiled with the corner of his mouth.</p> <p class="mb-4">“No,” he said calmly</p> <p class="mb-4">She looked out the porthole.</p> <p class="mb-4">“I wish I could sleep,” he said.</p> <p class="mb-4">“That would be nice,” she agreed.</p> <p class="mb-4">She started to dig around her tote. He watched her.</p> <p class="mb-4">“I&#39;ve got some chocolate. Would you like some?”</p> <p class="mb-4">Paul held out his hand. Julia dropped a few pieces in his palm. He popped them into his mouth.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Thanks.”</p> <p class="mb-4">She smiled. His eyes stayed on her. She was expectant.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Come here.” He waved her in to nestle under his arm.</p> <p class="mb-4">She went to him and fit next to him closely. He held her to him with his arm.</p> <p class="mb-4">“I was almost sent to prison for selling drugs,” he said.</p> <p class="mb-4">She didn&#39;t pull back from him.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Does that scare you?” he said.</p> <p class="mb-4">She wasn&#39;t sure. “No.” But maybe it did. “That&#39;s fine. You&#39;re starting a new life.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“I am.” He nodded and loosened his grip on her. She moved away from him.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Maybe I&#39;ll see you around. There aren&#39;t many people there,” she said.</p> <p class="mb-4">“There&#39;s enough and I hope we don&#39;t,” he said.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Why not?”</p> <p class="mb-4">He smiled at her. “You&#39;re married and I&#39;m a bad person.”</p> <p class="mb-4">She looked at the rubber floor. “My husband and I don&#39;t have the best relationship.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“You should work on it.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Why?” she said and looked at him.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Why not? Don&#39;t you love him?” he asked while looking out of the porthole.</p> <p class="mb-4">“It&#39;s been so long since we&#39;ve seen each other.”</p> <p class="mb-4">They were silent. He didn&#39;t start to hum.</p> <p class="mb-4">“We still might see each other,” she said.</p> <p class="mb-4">“I guess.”</p> <p class="mb-4">She went to the porthole and looked out.</p> <p class="mb-4">“I don&#39;t mind about the drugs,” she said.</p> <p class="mb-4">“It doesn&#39;t matter if you mind.”</p> <p class="mb-4">Julia sighed. She turned around and looked at him. “You are very handsome.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Thanks.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“I won&#39;t tell my husband about us.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“That will make your life easier.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Why don&#39;t you care?” She turned to him and leaned against the door.</p> <p class="mb-4">He laughed.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Do you care?” she asked.</p> <p class="mb-4">“You&#39;re a good person.”</p> <p class="mb-4">She looked away from him and crossed her arms over her chest.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Don&#39;t be so torn up about it,” he said.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Please don&#39;t tell me how I should feel.”</p> <p class="mb-4">He nodded his head. She looked at him. He was leaning against the wall in his corner, hands in
		his pockets.</p> <p class="mb-4">“You&#39;re very handsome.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“Stop it,” he barked.</p> <p class="mb-4">“I don&#39;t understand you.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“You&#39;re not going to.”</p> <p class="mb-4">She went up to him and wrapped her arms around his waist. He grabbed her hands and got her away.
		She tried again. He pushed her back.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Can&#39;t you just let me do this?” she asked.</p> <p class="mb-4">She reached for him again.</p> <p class="mb-4">He slapped her across the face. “I said stop it!”</p> <p class="mb-4">She covered her entire face in surprise and went to her corner. He started to hum. The moon came
		up in the porthole.</p> <p class="mb-4">“We&#39;re almost there,” he said.</p> <p class="mb-4">She stared at the moon. Her cheek stung.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Do you have any more chocolate?”</p> <p class="mb-4">She took her time to hand over the bag without looking at him. He smiled at her.</p> <p class="mb-4">The elevator stopped and the door slid open. He walked out and she followed.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Julia!” she heard. It was her husband. His smile was large and great. He held his arms out for
		her.</p> <p class="mb-4">She smiled and went to him.</p> <p class="mb-4">Paul walked to an information screen. “Sector B-87.”</p> <p class="mb-4">“My God. What happened to your face?” Her husband gently cupped her cheek.</p> <p class="mb-4">“Oh,” she laughed, “I was packing and knocked over books from the top shelf in the library.”</p> <p class="mb-4">Paul pushed through screens that were shown. “Sector A-163. That one.”</p> <p class="mb-4">Her husband kissed her and held her tight against him. “I missed you so much.”</p> <p class="mb-4">Paul left and then Julia and her husband headed home.</p></span></div> <span class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-center my-4"><hr class="w-1/2 !border-t-2"></span>  <ul class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-center"> <li><a href="/" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Home</span></a> </li><li class="mx-1 hidden sm:flex" data-svelte-h="svelte-13pvle1">|</li> <li><a href="/books" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Books</span></a> </li><li class="mx-1 hidden sm:flex" data-svelte-h="svelte-13pvle1">|</li> <li><a href="/short-stories" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Stories</span></a> </li><li class="mx-1 hidden sm:flex" data-svelte-h="svelte-13pvle1">|</li> <li><a href="/games" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Games</span></a> </li><li class="mx-1 hidden sm:flex" data-svelte-h="svelte-13pvle1">|</li> <li><a href="/software" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Software</span></a> </li></ul> <ul class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-center mt-4"> <li><a href="/legal" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">Legal</span></a> </li><li class="mx-1 hidden sm:flex" data-svelte-h="svelte-13pvle1">|</li> <li><a href="/about" class="hover:underline"><span class="flex-auto">About</span></a> </li></ul> <span class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-center my-4"><hr class="w-1/2 !border-t-2"></span> <span class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-center"><a class="hover:underline" href="mailto:contact@evilglasses.com" data-svelte-h="svelte-1r4kvog"><span class="fa-solid fa-envelope mr-1.5"></span>
