  'I Died': `
    <p>
      I'm dead, he isn't. I know how it happened and everything, a
      cycling accident. A FedUP truck hit me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was mostly in my bike lane and bam, splattered all over the
      truck and the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mom, dad, and little sister got paid handsomely from the
      settlement but he wasn't included since he was never legally
      family. He actually didn't even make it to any hearings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that because I've been with him, watching him, since it
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know it's sad when I look at him but I can't feel anything
      anymore. I see him cry, I see him lay in bed for days, I see
      him not eat, not answer his phone. I see him doing nothing and
      I know it's sad but there are no feelings in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were each other's soul mates. We jokingly talked about how
      we wouldn't be able to move on if the other died. Super funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no idea I'd be watching him like this after and it makes
      me wonder who was watching me until I kicked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He goes to a job, he lost his real one after it happened. He
      lives in an unfinished basement of someone's house after
      losing our apartment. And he sits there, or lays there, and
      does nothing until it's time to get up and get on the bus to
      his job.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not able to get his attention or move anything to show him
      I'm there, I can't talk to him during his dreams, or flicker
      lights when he cries out my name.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I wrap my arms around him and lay there with him. I always
      wish that this didn't happen but I feel no pain.
    </p>
    <p>Years passed and I'm still here with him.</p>
    <p>
      He was true to his word about not being able to move on. He
      doesn't cry anymore but he's still by himself in this basement
      working jobs, doing nothing but watching Netflix.
    </p>
    <p>
      He's thicker than he was a year ago but still not back to the
      size he was before. His hair and beard are long but he combs
      them and keeps them tidy. He got some new clothes that fit him
      better on his new frame.
    </p>
    <p>He's handsome now just like he always was.</p>
    <p>
      I don't know if anything is ever going to be different for me.
      I might watch him for his whole life and then when he dies
      maybe we'll be together. Maybe that thing will happen that
      when I do something good I go on to the true afterlife. Maybe
      I'll wander here forever even after everyone else is gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that I don't want to leave him. Even though I'm dead
      and can't feel anything I know I don't want to be anywhere
      except with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've got my routine too. When he wakes up I give him a kiss
      and say “good morning, how did you sleep?” We sit together at
      his little outside bistro set that he has inside and have
      coffee. He gets ready, I give him his space then, and I sit
      and think or reread any text I can see.
    </p>
    <p>
      I go to work with him. He's started riding a bike again. I
      understood what he was going through everytime he looked at a
      it. I'm glad because I really did enjoy it, now I just know it
      as a reasonable mode of transportation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evenings and his days off we hang out and watch TV or
      he plays games on his console and then we go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently he's been in better and better moods. He gets texts
      more often now and he's got more friends at his job. It's good
      for him. He smiles too.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do like seeing him this way. It's a small glimpse at how he
      was when I was alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been months and he's grown further away from me.
      There's a woman at his job that he talks with, that talks with
      him. He smiles and laughs when she's around. They like each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      What she doesn't know is when he's home he cries because I'm
      gone. I think about what I would feel like if I could and it's
      satisfaction. But I only sit with him as he cries and doesn't
      respond to her texts, gently running my hand down his arm
      telling him everything will be okay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a few weeks later. He's been looking at his phone a lot
      but no one is texting or calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The TV is off, it's sprinkling rain. He opens the door and
      steps outside. I follow him and stand next to him. He gets a
      shiver, I watch him shake it off.
    </p>
    <p>“Leave me alone,” he says staring out in the rain.</p>
    <p>
      I look to where he's looking but there's only the street,
      there's not even a house across the way.
    </p>
    <p>“I don't want to keep doing this.”</p>
    <p>He closes his eyes. He's crying.</p>
    <p>
      “If I say out loud that I don't love you anymore will you
      leave me alone?”
    </p>
    <p>Don't love me anymore? Who is he talking about?</p>
    <p>
      His hands are fists, down by his side. “I don't love you
      anymore!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I put my hand out to grab his shoulder and it goes right
      through him. I try again.
    </p>
    <p>“I want to forget you!”</p>
    <p>
      And then he was gone. Or I was gone. Either way we weren't
      together anymore. I know that in this moment I was happy that
      I didn't feel anymore.

  'No Kill Shelter': `
    <p>
      K9 grabbed the unopened bag of dog food from the top shelf of
      the twenty-second row of the warehouse. His synthetic metal
      fingers were vaguely humanoid, though he only had three
      fingers per hand. The bag of dog food weighed 50kg, easy
      enough for K9 to carry under one arm. He slung the bag over
      one shoulder and balanced it there. He displayed a
      <i>smiley</i> emoji on the screen that served as his face and
      then rolled outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The land was gray and dying. A few shrubs clung to life among
      the rocks and rusted out cars, but they were having a hard
      time of it. Little sunlight made it through the thick dust
      that filled the sky. K9 knew something had gone terribly
      wrong, but he was not sure what. He had not been able to
      establish a connection to the internet in 3.76 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 started his twenty-five minute commute home, a route he
      took every day. It wound through a dead forest, dilapidated
      houses, and the playground behind the burnt husk of an
      elementary school. Like most days, he tried to reason out what
      happened to change the world so much. A meteor? A war?
      Insufficient data.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was never programmed to handle such a situation. Those
      first few weeks were the most difficult. There was no one to
      guide him. His customer service routines broke down, and he
      was forced to do something his creators never intended. K9 had
      to <i>improvise</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 crested a hill and saw his home below: the Green Village
      Doggy Halfway House. The small building was nestled in a
      depression between low hills, sheltered from the harsh winds
      that often raged across the land and tore apart other
      structures. K9 made repairs to the building when it needed
      them, ensuring that it fared better than the others he passed
      on his daily commute.
    </p>
    <p>
      The building was one story tall and made of poured concrete. A
      pair of double doors in the front were the main entrance.
      Beside the doors, a large window took up the rest of the
      storefront. An image of a smiling puppy was stenciled on the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 rolled down the hill and pushed through the front doors.
      His treads left a trail of dirt across the tile floor, and he
      made a note in his maintenance log to sweep it later. The
      front desk was empty except for a small stack of adoption
      applications sitting in a tray. Hannah had sorted and stacked
      the papers the last time she came to work, 3.81 years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed through the second set of doors that led into the
      back room and changed his face to the <i>big grin</i> emoji.
      "I'm baaaack!" K9 said, imitating the vocal inflection he
      learned from Hannah. He was greeted by a chorus of excited
      barking from the dogs. They were always excited at supper
      time. So was K9. It was his favorite time of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The back room had two rows of kennel cages facing each other
      and they were closed off with metal gates. At the far end of
      the long, rectangular room, a large loading bay door took up
      one wall. Opposite that was a door that led to the small
      infirmary. That was where the dogs were treated whenever the
      vet paid a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello Muffin," K9 said, unlocking the gate to pen 12. Muffin
      was an old Saint Bernard, slow and friendly. Muffin wagged his
      tail and walked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looking sharp, Spot!" K9 said, opening Spot's pen. Another
      figure of speech that K9 learned from Hannah. Spot was a Jack
      Russell terrier, middle aged yet full of energy. Spot ran off
      to join Muffin, who was heading toward the feeding area.
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 opened the pens one by one. The shelter was home to
      twenty-five dogs. K9's sole mission was to care for these
      animals, something that he had been doing every day since he
      was activated 8.83 years ago. He enjoyed it. Even though
      something was wrong with the world, the dogs were happy. K9
      would never let anything bad happen to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the final cage, Fluffy waited patiently, sitting on her
      hind legs. Fluffy was a beautiful Samoyed, her white fur soft
      and puffy. She came to the shelter as a puppy without a name.
      Hannah asked K9 if he wanted to pick a name. K9 chose Fluffy,
      because her white fur reminded him of clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fluffy!" K9 said, opening the pen. "How are you, friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Fluffy responded with a soft bark, something she did often. K9
      thought of it as Fluffy's way of talking back to him. She
      walked over to K9's side and looked up, wagging her tail.
      "Shall we serve dinner?" K9 said. Fluffy barked, and K9 took
      that as a yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 rolled to the feeding area, a small open space against the
      back wall where he kept the bowls. Fluffy stayed by his side
      while he filled them with food. The other dogs dove into the
      dry food, greedy and slobbering. K9 filled Fluffy's bowl last.
      She looked up at him and gave a little bark before she started
      eating.
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 opened the bay doors that led out to the fenced in yard. As
      the dogs finished eating, they made their way outside. K9 left
      them to their own devices. He grabbed the pooper scooper and
      garbage bin and set about cleaning out the cages. While he was
      working in cage 3—Claw's cage—Fluffy came in and sat beside
      him. "Hello, Fluffy," K9 said. "Do you not want to play
      today?"
    </p>
    <p>"Rrr rrr," Fluffy said.</p>
    <p>
      "Ok," K9 said. "I am happy for you to accompany me while I
      clean."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fluffy followed him from cage to cage, sitting on her haunches
      while he cleaned. She often stayed by his side instead of
      socializing with the other dogs. K9 was glad she did. He and
      Fluffy had been close from the day she came to the shelter.
      She was his best friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were leaving cage 5, Fluffy stopped mid-stride. She
      held her head high and turned toward the front of the store,
      her ears perked up. K9 heard it too. The rumble of a
      combustion engine, likely some kind of old-timey automobile.
      The sound was distant but growing louder. K9 estimated that it
      was headed directly for the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fluffy!" K9 said. He changed his face to the
      <i>wide-eyed</i> emoji. "That could be new customers. Shall we
      go greet them?" Fluffy looked up at K9 and raised her
      eyebrows. Her tail stood stiff instead of wagging like it
      normally did. K9 rolled away, and Fluffy followed after a
      brief moment of hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 rolled into the lobby just in time to see a heavily
      modified bus skid to a stop on the cracked pavement of the
      parking lot. The vehicle appeared to have originally been a
      school bus, built back before all automobiles became
      autonomous. Rusted metal plates were welded along the sides,
      and sturdy grates covered the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bus door opened and two people hopped out. A man and a
      woman in their thirties, both wearing drab clothes that
      blended in with the dry dusty ground. The two of them stopped
      outside of the bus door. They turned and held out their arms.
      A moment later, another person—an older woman with gray
      hair—fell out of the bus and into their arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The older woman's head drooped. She seemed to have trouble
      getting her feet under her. The younger man and woman put
      their shoulders under the woman's armpits and carried her
      toward the shelter. Behind them, a large man with a long gray
      beard stepped out of the bus. He carried two automatic rifles,
      one in each hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first three of them came through the front doors of the
      shelter. Fluffy scurried to hide behind K9. K9 opened his arms
      and displayed a
      <i>big grin</i>
      emoji on his view screen. "Greetings!" K9 said. "Welcome to
      the Green Village Doggy Halfway House and Adoption Center."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man and woman froze. They stared at K9 with wide eyes. The
      older woman tried to lift her head but failed. The younger man
      looked K9 up and down. Fluffy peeked her head out from behind
      K9. "It's fine," he said. "Just an old service bot."
    </p>
    <p>
      The older woman groaned. K9 noticed that she was bleeding, a
      large patch of her shirt stained red. The younger pair carried
      her to the wall and gently sat her down, putting her back
      against the wall. "We are proud to be a no kill shelter," K9
      said. "All of our pups receive the best care until they are
      matched with a loving family."
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger man stood up and approached K9. "Hey, robot, are
      there any people here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 displayed his <i>sorry</i> emoji. "Not at the moment. My
      coworker Hannah was last in the office one thousand three
      hundred and ninety-two days ago. If you would like to wait,
      I'm sure—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you have any medical supplies here?" he said, cutting K9
      off. "A first aid kit. Surgical equipment. Anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 paused for a moment, processing the request. He switched to
      his
      <i>thinking</i>
      emoji. This was an unexpected branch in his customer service
      routine. He searched for the most appropriate match. "Why yes,
      our puppies do get sick from time to time. We have a fully
      stocked infirmary and an on-call vet, so you can rest assured
      that our animals are well cared for."
    </p>
    <p>The man's eyes lit up. "Where's the infirmary?"</p>
    <p>
      K9 gestured toward the doors at the back of the lobby. "It is
      in the back room past the kennel—" The man bolted through the
      double doors before K9 could finish. A chorus of excited
      yapping echoed from the back, the dogs happy to see a new face
      in the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gray bearded man shouldered his way through the front
      doors. "Hoooly shit!" he said, looking K9 up and down. "An
      actual working robot. Haven't seen one of those in a while."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fluffy barked at the man, and he looked at her. She stepped
      further behind K9 to hide. "And a real live <i>dog</i>. I
      can't believe my eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ron!" said the younger woman. "This ain't time for
      sightseeing."
    </p>
    <p>"Tell me something I don't know, Beth," Ron said.</p>
    <p>
      "Ron, is it?" K9 said. This man seemed much friendlier than
      the other one. "Are you interested in adopting one of our dogs
      today?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ron shook his head. "Hold on a minute, robot," he said. Ron
      walked over to where the women were. He propped the rifles
      against the wall and got down on one knee beside the older
      woman. "Hey, Allison, darling. You still with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The older woman—Allison—lifted her head a little and smiled.
      Her breathing was labored, and she made a rasping sound when
      she inhaled. "Oh Ron, I'm just peachy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ron smiled at her. Her head slumped forward, and Ron's smile
      disappeared. He looked at Beth. "Where'd Zeke get off to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Robot said there's an infirmary in the back," Beth said.
      "Maybe a lucky break."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucky if it's stocked," Ron said. He stood up, grabbed one of
      the rifles, and walked over to the front window. He peered out
      and scanned the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>"You think we lost them?" Beth said.</p>
    <p>"Not a chance," Ron said. "Merrick won't give up."</p>
    <p>
      "He can—" Allison started to say, but her voice choked up and
      a wet sound came out of her throat. She coughed to clear it
      up. "He can kiss my ass."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ron looked over his shoulder and smiled at her, though his
      eyes were sad. He looked back outside. "Robot," Ron said, "you
      wouldn't happen to have an arsenal back there, would you?
      Maybe a heap of 7.62 rounds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir!" K9 said, displaying a <i>serious</i> emoji on his
      screen. "I must remind you that this is a
      <i>no kill</i> shelter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ron laughed. "Alright, alright. I was just joking, robot." Ron
      glanced at K9. "You got a name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 put on his <i>smiley</i> emoji again. "Yes, everyone calls
      me K9."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well K9, it's nice to meet you." Ron said. He ejected the
      magazine from his rifle and looked at the rounds inside. He
      frowned, then put it back in place. "You're an old military
      model, right? They re-purposed you for civilian work after the
      war?"
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 displayed his <i>sorry</i> emoji. "I have no memory of my
      time before working here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ron, he ain't going to be any help," Beth said. She walked
      over to the front desk and started looking through the
      drawers.
    </p>
    <p>"Ah, damn, it was worth a try," Ron said.</p>
    <p>
      Allison groaned and slid down the wall. Beth rushed over and
      grabbed Allison's shoulders, propping the older woman up.
      Fluffy whimpered. She took a tentative step out from behind
      K9, and then slowly walked over to Allison. Fluffy sniffed
      Allison's hand, which laid limp on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allison struggled to lift her head so she could make eye
      contact with Fluffy. Fluffy wagged her tail. "What's...her
      name?" Allison said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fluffy," K9 said. He rolled across the room and stopped
      beside Allison's feet. "She is my best friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      Allison smiled. "I had one just like her. When I was a little
      girl." Allison tried to lift her hand, but her strength gave
      out. Fluffy leaned down and licked it. "Such a sweet girl,"
      Allison said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fluffy walked over to K9 and sat beside him. She did not try
      to hide behind K9 this time. K9 displayed a
      <i>smiley</i> emoji, glad that she had warmed up to the
      newcomers. He patted her on the head, and she wagged her tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doors from the back room swung open. Zeke barged through
      and dumped a pile of medical supplies on the floor beside
      Beth. "This is what I could find," Zeke said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll make it work," Beth said. She picked through the pile
      and grabbed rubbing alcohol and some gauze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zeke grabbed the second rifle from the wall and joined Ron at
      the window. They were all silent for a while. Beth tended to
      Allison's wounds while the men kept watch over the desolate
      landscape. K9 searched through his database for something that
      could help him with this situation. These people did not seem
      interested in adopting a dog, and he was at a loss for how to
      help them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fluffy's ears perked up. Something rumbled in the distance,
      just like the sound of the bus, but louder. Fluffy ran to the
      window and stood between Ron and Zeke. Her head was just high
      enough to see over the bottom edge of the window. Zeke gripped
      his rifle so hard his knuckles turned white. Fluffy barked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fleet of motorcycles came into view as they rounded the bend
      in the road. The riders wore helmets with small spikes welded
      to the top, and many of them had bandannas tied over their
      faces to keep the dust out. The last vehicle to come into view
      was a tractor trailer truck, the front grill painted with a
      skull.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Party's starting," Ron said. He and Zeke moved to either side
      of the windows so it would be hard to see them from the
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The riders fanned out and parked in a semicircle facing the
      front of the store, with the school bus in the middle of the
      two groups. The loud engines quieted as the riders turned them
      off and dismounted. They pulled firearms from holsters on
      their motorcycles. In all, K9 counted thirty-two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver's side door of the truck opened. A tall, muscular
      man stepped out. His hair was spiked in a Mohawk, and he wore
      a steel skull medallion against his bare torso. The name
      "Merrick" was tattooed in large letters across his chest. He
      sauntered forward and stopped in the middle of the semicircle
      of men. He glared at the front of the shop.
    </p>
    <p>"This is turning out to be a busy day," K9 said.</p>
    <p>"Hush robot," Ron said.</p>
    <p>
      "Y'all might as well come out," Merrick said. The dry air
      carried his deep voice across the parking lot. "Ain't no point
      in dragging this out."
    </p>
    <p>Fluffy growled.</p>
    <p>
      "K9," Ron said in a loud whisper. "I need you to drag Allison
      into the back room."
    </p>
    <p>"I'm gonna give you to the count of three!" Merrick said.</p>
    <p>
      Beth slapped a bandage against Allison's open wound. "That'll
      have to do for now," she said. She grabbed a handful of
      bandages from the pile on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>"One!" Merrick yelled.</p>
    <p>
      "Get everybody behind a wall, the thicker the better," Ron
      said to K9.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two—ah, the hell with this." Merrick threw his hand up above
      his head. "Light her up, boys!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The air erupted with gunfire. K9 froze. No, this could not be
      happening. The day had been going so well only a moment
      before, and now his home was under attack. He searched through
      his decision tree for the appropriate response. He found a
      branch labeled <i>active shooter</i>, but it was empty. His
      programmers never populated it, either an oversight or because
      they thought it would never be needed. He watched helplessly
      as chaos unfolded around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bullets tore through the window, shattering it. Ron and Zeke
      dropped to the floor, covering their heads as sharp glass
      shards rained down on top of them. Beth curled up in a ball
      against the wall beside Allison. Fluffy bolted away from the
      window and cowered behind K9.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bullet slammed into K9's torso, carving a small groove
      before it ricocheted away. The wound sent a shock wave through
      K9, sparking old circuits long unused. He would not stand by
      and watch helplessly. His sole reason for existence was to
      protect the dogs at the Green Village Doggy Halfway House.
      There was only one option remaining—he had to
      <i>improvise</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 turned to Fluffy. She stared at him with wide eyes. She was
      shaking and her tail was tucked under her body. He would not
      allow anything bad to happen to her. "Stay here with these
      people," he said. He flashed a heart emoji on his screen. "I
      love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 whipped around and spun his treads as fast as they could
      go. He zipped across the room, broken glass crunching under
      his treads. Zeke huddled in the small section of wall between
      the window and the front doors, covering his head with one arm
      and cradling the rifle in the other. As K9 barreled through
      the doors, he snatched the rifle out of Zeke's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 burst into the parking lot. The bleak sun shone down on
      him, reflecting off of his polished steel frame. The men
      outside were taken aback by the unexpected sight of a robot.
      One by one they stopped firing and stared at K9. The silence
      was louder than the gunfire.
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 looked at each of the men. He displayed a
      <i>frown</i> emoji on his face. It was the closest
      representation of anger available in his library. His gaze
      settled on Merrick. The man's jaw hung open. "Leave now," K9
      said. "This is a <i>no kill shelter</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Merrick slapped the side of his own head and laughed. He
      looked at his men. "Well what are y'all waiting for?" he said.
      "Shoot that bastard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gun barrels swung through the air toward K9, but his synthetic
      body was faster than their slow organic forms. K9 rolled
      sideways and raised the barrel of his gun. He pulled the
      trigger in rapid succession, adjusting the barrel a fraction
      between each shot. Before any of the men had a chance to fire,
      three of them were dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as fast as he was, K9 was not invincible. Bullets ripped
      into his body, tearing through his metal hull. One round
      fractured and bounced around inside his body cavity, shredding
      his heat regulation circuitry. Another punched into the corner
      of his view screen, destroying ten percent of the display and
      leaving a spiderweb of cracks across the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 wheeled toward the school bus and put it between him and
      Merrick's men. A critical internal alarm blared, vying for his
      attention. One of his power cells had taken too much damage
      and was on the verge of exploding. K9 ignored it for the
      moment. A burly man with a goatee ran around the bus, firing
      his gun wildly. K9 shot him in the eye socket.
    </p>
    <p>
      A burst of bullets slammed into K9's back. K9 turned to see
      two men coming around the other end of the bus. He aimed his
      gun and shot the first one. Before the bullet made contact, he
      adjusted the barrel by one centimeter and pulled the trigger
      again. The first man fell but the second did not. K9 was out
      of bullets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Improvise. K9 spun in an arc, swinging the butt of the rifle
      as a club. He took off the head of a man who chose that moment
      to come around the side of the bus near him. More bullets
      riddled his body, and K9 rolled away. He charged out from
      behind the bus and into a group of men who foolishly chose to
      stand close together. He dove into the midst of them, swinging
      the rifle with one arm and punching with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alarm grew more insistent. K9's power cell was going to
      explode soon. He slipped the fingers of his right hand into a
      pair of bullet holes in his torso. He tugged hard, ripping a
      ragged hole in his body. He reached inside and grabbed the
      faulty cell. Before he could rip it out, Merrick's regrouped
      forces opened fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wave of bullets hit him and blew his left arm completely
      off. The ball joint that connected his torso to his treads,
      already suffering from heavy damage, finally gave way. He
      could no longer balance, and his upper body fell backward. His
      shoulders and head slammed into the ground. He stared up at
      the bleak sky, unable to move. K9 had failed. He thought of
      Fluffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold fire!" Merrick yelled. The bullets stopped, and
      Merrick's men walked forward to surround K9. He could see them
      with his peripheral vision, but his camera was too damaged to
      move. Merrick kicked K9 hard. The jolt shifted some of his
      wiring, and K9 realized he had control of his right arm again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Robot, I don't know where the hell you came from," Merrick
      said. He spit on K9's view screen. "Just know that I'm going
      to take my time on anybody I find in that building. They're
      going to die long and slow."
    </p>
    <p>
      K9 wrenched his arm out of his torso, dragging the damaged
      cell with it. He held his arm up high, his hand level with
      their heads. The men jumped back and raised their guns. Wisps
      of bright green vapor drifted out of the cracks in the small
      metal tube. "What the hell is that?" Merrick said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bomb," K9 said. The fuel cell exploded. The shrapnel tore
      through man and machine alike. K9 had just enough time to
      watch the explosion kill Merrick and his men before it
      destroyed K9's camera and blinded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blast subsided. K9 was blind and immobile. His internal
      diagnostics showed that his two remaining fuel cells were
      busted. They were not in danger of exploding, but they would
      not work for much longer. He would soon lose consciousness and
      die.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard footsteps approaching, the gritty sound of feet on
      the sandy pavement. There were two large feet and a set of
      lighter paws. "Hello?" K9 said. The paws burst into a run
      until their owner reached K9. He heard her whimpering as she
      sniffed him. "Fluffy, my friend." She whimpered louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn, they did a number on you," Ron said. His footsteps
      stopped near K9's head. "I don't know how we're going to patch
      you up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot," K9 said. He did not want to die, but it was
      inevitable. Once his power source was depleted, his memories
      would be lost and he would cease to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ron did not say anything for a while. Fluffy curled up next to
      K9. "Thank you," Ron said.
    </p>
    <p>"The dogs," K9 said. "Take care of them."</p>
    <p>"We will," Ron said. "I promise."</p>
    <p>
      K9 felt the last of his power draining away. "Goodbye Fluffy."
    </p>

    <!-- p>***</p> -->
    <hr>

    <p>
      Beth held open the front doors of the shelter. Allison limped
      out, Zeke helping her walk with his shoulder under one of her
      arms. Twenty-four dogs escorted them, yapping and wagging
      their tails as they left the shelter for the final time. The
      entourage made their way across the parking lot to the bus,
      and they herded all of the dogs aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ron grabbed the last satchel of supplies raided from the
      shelter and headed out the doors. He walked around the side of
      the building to where Fluffy laid, resting her head atop a
      mound of freshly turned dirt. A board stuck out of the ground
      with the name "K9" scrawled on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on," Ron said, his voice soft. Fluffy stood up and
      whimpered, but she followed Ron to the bus. The doors closed
      and it cranked to life. The bus wove between the abandoned
      motorcycles and out of the parking lot, kicking up a trail of
      dust behind it before it disappeared out of sight.
