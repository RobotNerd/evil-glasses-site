      EOW INSURANCE THIS IS AGENT# CDK556. CONRAD.BILL (POLICY#
      YHG456) KNOWN DWELLING IS OVERRUN BY TROLLS. AREA SURROUNDING
      THE MAIN DWELLING HAS A NUMBER OF HUMAN REMAINS, EITHER OUT IN
      THE OPEN, NAILED TO TREES, OR IN TROLL PILES. ONE PILE HAS A
      HUMAN HEAD THAT STRONGLY RESEMBLES POLICYHOLDER. SENDING
      IMAGE. STANDING BY FOR RECEIPT CONFIRMATION AND SATISFACTION
      NOTICE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson Morris (otherwise known as Agent# CDK556, and Jax to
      everyone else) hit send on his mobile unit after punching in
      the message. The thick, heavy duty buttons made typing out
      long messages annoying, if not tiring; a small price to pay so
      that the device would work in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting the device aside, he picked up his camera and used the
      zoom feature to watch the house. He had taken enough pictures;
      he just wanted to make sure he knew where the Trolls were. So
      far he counted nine, which in the Troll world was quite a bit.
      Trolls have a strong patriarchal hierarchy where every group
      is lead by the strongest male. The problem for Trolls is that
      every male thinks they are the strongest, which leads to
      constant fights where the pecking order is reestablished
      multiple times a day. Normally these fights are a quick punch,
      bite or kick; and then followed up with a severe beating by
      the current “head of state.” Every once and a while, these
      fights get nasty, and the challenging male does not back down
      as easy, and a Troll dies…
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these fights took place as he watched the house and
      waited for a response. Jackson was happy that the Trolls were
      busy with each other, and not looking around for something to
      kill <code>&#8212;</code> responses from the Wave Net could
      take anywhere from minutes to hours, depending on how the
      messages were picked up and relayed. Wave Net devices throw
      out their messages to a variety of radio bands and wavelengths
      in small packets. Eventually, the intended recipient gets all
      the packets, and thus, a complete message. No longer are there
      reliable cell-towers, satellite phones, or other rapid
      communication technologies. Wave Net uses parts of all of the
      old tech, when it can, and the senders hope the messages get
      through. It's like a hacked together crappy telegraph without
      the wires, but with the ability to send simple photographs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied that the Trolls were not going anywhere anytime
      soon, Jackson slowly crawled backwards down the ridge he was
      using for cover, taking his Wave Net communicator and camera
      with him. He shimmied down to the rest of his gear; where his
      backpack and carbine were leaning against a tree, silently
      awaiting his return.
    </p>
    <p>Jax waited.</p>
    <p>
      He ate some food; a compressed cake of corn, berries, seeds
      and dried beef. It was not that bad for field food, and had
      all the nutrients that his body needed.
    </p>
    <p>Jax waited.</p>
    <p>
      He drank some fresh apple juice out of an old sports-drink
      bottle.
    </p>
    <p>Jax waited.</p>
    <p>
      He checked on the Trolls; one was beating another over the
      head with what looked like a human leg, as he ate what looked
      like a human arm.
    </p>
    <p>Jax waited.</p>
    <p>
      He wiped down the outside and lightly lubed the bolt on his
      carbine, an old Sig Sauer 553. He was once told that the Sig
      showed people that he had taste, was a connoisseur of old euro
      tech, someone who knew weapons
      <code>&#8212;</code> and not to be trifled with. In reality,
      he could give a shit. He was not a gun person, and never
      really understood the appeal. He needed something for
      protection in the field, and something that made him not look
      like a victim in town. He won the carbine in a card game with
      a pair of nines and kept it because it did not weigh a lot.
    </p>
    <p>Jax waited.</p>
    <p>
      The temperature was still nice, about the mid 80's. Summertime
      in the Free Northwest can't be beat Jackson thought to himself
      as he noticed that the “Message” light on his Wave Net device
      was glowing a dull green.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jax stretched his arms wide, a slight “uhhhhh” escaped his
      lips at the apex.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Time to get the fuck out of here,” he quietly said as he
      picked up the device and hit “receive.”
    </p>
    <p>
      AGENT# CDK556 THIS IS EOW INSURANCE. POLICY NOT SATISFIED.
      SATISFACTION CONDITIONS ON POLICY ARE LISTED AS ABSOLUTE.
      FULFILL ABSOLUTE SATISFACTION REQUIREMENTS AND REPORT BACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What the shit? Absolute?” Jackson pulled out Bill's policy
      and jumped to the satisfaction terms. They were listed as
      “probable,” just as he knew they were, because he looked at it
      this morning over a decent cup of toasted barley tea (that the
      proprietor had the balls to call new coffee). He flipped to
      the last page of the policy and looked at the insurance issuer
      rights notes and saw the word “seconds.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Those shady mother…” Selling insurance in a world where
      everything is trying to kill you is a losing proposition at
      best. The big guys can make a little on volume, where the
      small guys make it on spread or you actually dying. What they
      do is sell you a policy for a decent chunk of change because
      you have loose satisfaction terms, then, they buy a policy on
      you to cover the expense of paying out (or even above the
      amount of your current policy), but with stricter satisfaction
      terms so they can get it for cheaper. The difference between
      the two pays the company every month, and when you die, they
      get a nice payday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jax just gave his company proof enough that they will have to
      pay out, now he needed to get proof so that his company would
      get paid. He instantly knew that there was no arguing or
      complaining, absolute is absolute, and End Of World Insurance
      wants their money.

  'Elevator to the Moon': `
    <p>“Just the two of us,” he said to her.</p>
    <p>
      She barely smiled while looking at the floor holding her small
      tote bag.
    </p>
    <p>“I'm Paul.”</p>
    <p>“Hello, I'm Julia.”</p>
    <p>They didn't shake hands.</p>
    <p>
      He stood in one of the two back corners and she stood in the
      other. Both looked out of the only porthole as the earth moved
      further away.
    </p>
    <p>“This is weird right?” Paul asked with a smile.</p>
    <p>She shrugged her shoulders and shook her head.</p>
    <p>“You're very beautiful.”</p>
    <p>She turned her head away from him but blushed.</p>
    <p>
      “You know that though, right? You must get that all the time.
      It is true.”
    </p>
    <p>“Thank you,” she said.</p>
    <p>
      “Women often think that I'm handsome.” He smiled at her even
      though she wasn't looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>She nodded.</p>
    <p>
      “I really wish you'd talk to me. This is such a long trip.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the two steps to the porthole to watch the earth.
      “Come look.” He urged her over.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to his side and looked out. There it was, Earth.
      Moving away form them as they ascended to the moon.
    </p>
    <p>“It's marvelous,” she said.</p>
    <p>
      He watched the earth and she looked at him from the corner of
      her eye. He was very handsome, tall, muscular.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You—you are handsome,” she said looking out of the porthole.
    </p>
    <p>He smiled. “I know.”</p>
    <p>“Why are you going to the moon?” she said.</p>
    <p>
      Paul sighed and ran his hand through his hair. “Earth isn't
      kind to everyone.”
    </p>
    <p>“I'm sorry to hear that.”</p>
    <p>
      “It's not your fault. I'm sure if I knew you there I could
      have stayed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia went back to her space and put down her tote. The
      elevator they were in had black walls, black rubber floor,
      stainless steal trim. The porthole was the only thing that let
      them know they weren't simply going to the top floor of a tall
      building.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hopefully it's better for the both of us.” She crossed her
      arms over her chest. “Are you feeling fine?” She asked him.
    </p>
    <p>“Yeah.” He turned and looked at her.</p>
    <p>
      “Oh.” She took a deep breath. “I think my body is reacting to
      the travel shot.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is there anything I can do?” He stood in front of her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don't know. I'm sure I couldn't throw up even if I had to.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveling shot they both received retarded their body
      functions to trick them into feeling like a few hours had
      passed instead of the three days. They couldn't eat, sleep,
      use the restroom.
    </p>
    <p>“I'm sure you'll feel better soon,” he said.</p>
    <p>
      “Thank you.” She looked at him. He was smiling at her and she
      smiled back.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stayed quiet for a while. He started to hum and she
      looked out the porthole. Now there were only stars.
    </p>
    <p>“They're so unfamiliar,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Hmm?”</p>
    <p>“The stars. I don't recognize anything.”</p>
    <p>
      He stood next to her and looked. “Yeah.” He looked at her. He
      reached out with his hand and turned her face toward him. She
      looked at him now. He kissed her softly but completely without
      question. She didn't kiss back.
    </p>
    <p>“I—I am married,” Julia said.</p>
    <p>“Oh.” Paul gave a small smile.</p>
    <p>“My husband is on the moon. I'm going up to be with him.”</p>
    <p>
      “He's a lucky man.” He stepped back from her and leaned
      against the same corner of the elevator that they began their
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the stars again. “He's been there for three
      years.”
    </p>
    <p>“What's he do?”</p>
    <p>“Air chemical engineer.”</p>
    <p>Paul laughed. “Someone we all need.”</p>
    <p>
      She nodded. A bit later she went back to her original corner.
      He started to hum again and slid down to sit on the floor,
      legs out in front of him. She went over to him, squatted down
      and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>He didn't kiss back.</p>
    <p>She pulled away and looked in his eyes.</p>
    <p>“Are you done?” he asked.</p>
    <p>“Uh.” She was startled. “Yes.”</p>
    <p>She stood and went back.</p>
    <p>“Why did you do that?” he asked.</p>
    <p>“I guess I didn't mind you kissing me.”</p>
    <p>“You're married.”</p>
    <p>She nodded.</p>
    <p>
      He stood up and turned his body to her but leaned against the
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It's only unfortunate for me that you're married,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head without looking at him. “No, not just you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul reached out and took her hand. She looked at him. He
      kissed her and she kissed back. His hands moved deftly around
      her body and under her clothes. She moaned and pulled her body
      against his. They kissed sloppily and rushed, they breathed
      into each other's ears and necks. Soon they were both exposed
      and he was inside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished and slumped down next to her. She moved to nestle
      her head on his shoulder. He smiled and stood up before she
      could settle.
    </p>
    <p>
      She propped herself up and watched him dress. He smiled at
      her.
    </p>
    <p>“You're beautiful,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Thanks. That was great,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Yeah.”</p>
    <p>
      He stretched a bit and stood in his corner. She got up and
      gathered her clothes and dressed. She stood in her corner.
    </p>
    <p>“What are you going to do once you get there?” she asked.</p>
    <p>“Find a job.”</p>
    <p>“What did you do on Earth?”</p>
    <p>“It doesn't matter.”</p>
    <p>“Oh. I won't say anything bad about it.”</p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with a plain face, and then smiled with the
      corner of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>“No,” he said calmly</p>
    <p>She looked out the porthole.</p>
    <p>“I wish I could sleep,” he said.</p>
    <p>“That would be nice,” she agreed.</p>
    <p>She started to dig around her tote. He watched her.</p>
    <p>“I've got some chocolate. Would you like some?”</p>
    <p>
      Paul held out his hand. Julia dropped a few pieces in his
      palm. He popped them into his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>“Thanks.”</p>
    <p>She smiled. His eyes stayed on her. She was expectant.</p>
    <p>“Come here.” He waved her in to nestle under his arm.</p>
    <p>
      She went to him and fit next to him closely. He held her to
      him with his arm.
    </p>
    <p>“I was almost sent to prison for selling drugs,” he said.</p>
    <p>She didn't pull back from him.</p>
    <p>“Does that scare you?” he said.</p>
    <p>
      She wasn't sure. “No.” But maybe it did. “That's fine. You're
      starting a new life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am.” He nodded and loosened his grip on her. She moved away
      from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe I'll see you around. There aren't many people there,”
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>“There's enough and I hope we don't,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Why not?”</p>
    <p>He smiled at her. “You're married and I'm a bad person.”</p>
    <p>
      She looked at the rubber floor. “My husband and I don't have
      the best relationship.”
    </p>
    <p>“You should work on it.”</p>
    <p>“Why?” she said and looked at him.</p>
    <p>
      “Why not? Don't you love him?” he asked while looking out of
      the porthole.
    </p>
    <p>“It's been so long since we've seen each other.”</p>
    <p>They were silent. He didn't start to hum.</p>
    <p>“We still might see each other,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I guess.”</p>
    <p>She went to the porthole and looked out.</p>
    <p>“I don't mind about the drugs,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It doesn't matter if you mind.”</p>
    <p>
      Julia sighed. She turned around and looked at him. “You are
      very handsome.”
    </p>
    <p>“Thanks.”</p>
    <p>“I won't tell my husband about us.”</p>
    <p>“That will make your life easier.”</p>
    <p>
      “Why don't you care?” She turned to him and leaned against the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>He laughed.</p>
    <p>“Do you care?” she asked.</p>
    <p>“You're a good person.”</p>
    <p>
      She looked away from him and crossed her arms over her chest.
    </p>
    <p>“Don't be so torn up about it,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Please don't tell me how I should feel.”</p>
    <p>
      He nodded his head. She looked at him. He was leaning against
      the wall in his corner, hands in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>“You're very handsome.”</p>
    <p>“Stop it,” he barked.</p>
    <p>“I don't understand you.”</p>
    <p>“You're not going to.”</p>
    <p>
      She went up to him and wrapped her arms around his waist. He
      grabbed her hands and got her away. She tried again. He pushed
      her back.
    </p>
    <p>“Can't you just let me do this?” she asked.</p>
    <p>She reached for him again.</p>
    <p>He slapped her across the face. “I said stop it!”</p>
    <p>
      She covered her entire face in surprise and went to her
      corner. He started to hum. The moon came up in the porthole.
    </p>
    <p>“We're almost there,” he said.</p>
    <p>She stared at the moon. Her cheek stung.</p>
    <p>“Do you have any more chocolate?”</p>
    <p>
      She took her time to hand over the bag without looking at him.
      He smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elevator stopped and the door slid open. He walked out and
      she followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Julia!” she heard. It was her husband. His smile was large
      and great. He held his arms out for her.
    </p>
    <p>She smiled and went to him.</p>
    <p>Paul walked to an information screen. “Sector B-87.”</p>
    <p>
      “My God. What happened to your face?” Her husband gently
      cupped her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” she laughed, “I was packing and knocked over books from
      the top shelf in the library.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul pushed through screens that were shown. “Sector A-163.
      That one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband kissed her and held her tight against him. “I
      missed you so much.”
    </p>
    <p>Paul left and then Julia and her husband headed home.</p>`,






  'Cloned': `
    <p>
      "It isn't natural," Susan said. She ran her hand across the
      rock face above her, feeling for a handhold. The warmth from
      the sun was in perfect balance with the crisp air. This was
      turning out to be a great day for climbing. "You're not going
      to be able to convince me otherwise, Roger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll never understand you," Roger said from below her. Today
      was Susan's turn to be the lead climber. She and Roger did not
      get much time to climb anymore. The last time they were out
      had been seven months ago, and she missed it. She often
      daydreamed about being out on the rock while sitting in her
      cramped windowless office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cloning people, Roger!" Susan said. She found a hold and
      gripped it with her fingertips. "That's insane. It's like body
      snatchers. Some imposter is walking around wearing your skin
      and using your memories, but they don't have your soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger laughed. "There you go again with the metaphysical
      talk," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan shook her head. "You don't have to believe," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's why I love you," Roger said. Susan was looking at the
      rock, but she could hear the smile in his voice. It made her
      smile too.
    </p>
    <p>
      They climbed in silence for a while. The ground shrank away
      and the wind picked up. Susan looked up at the vast blue sky
      above her, not a cloud in sight. What a day to be alive.
    </p>
    <p>"I'm going to invest," Roger said.</p>
    <p>
      Susan smiled. Roger became an unstoppable force when he had
      something on his mind. It was one of his quirks that she had
      gotten used to. She still loved him as much as she did when
      they first started dating. From years of experience with him,
      she learned it was easier to humor him.
    </p>
    <p>"You'll lose our money," she said.</p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry about that," Roger said. "I won't invest our
      joint savings. I'll cash out my bonds. And even if I lose it
      all—which I won't—we'll have our backup plan for our
      retirement."
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan wanted to tell him no, and it was not because of the
      money. Roger's long time friend Ganesh had graduated from MIT
      with a Ph.D. in bioengineering. Ganesh had a very successful
      career in the financial industry, but he had quit to get back
      to his roots. Ganesh approached Roger about investing in a
      startup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ganesh believed he was on the verge of a breakthrough in
      cloning. He had spent nights and weekends in a makeshift lab
      in his tiny Brooklyn apartment. He self-funded everything
      using his ibanker salary. Ganesh was the only person she knew
      who could be considered a true mad scientist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan only knew of this second-hand through Roger. She and
      Ganesh weren't on speaking terms. As much as she wanted to
      think it was a hoax, she believed it was probably real. Ganesh
      was brilliant, and if he said that he would do something, he
      always followed through. Always.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roger, I don't think it's right," she said. She knew he was
      prepping his argument, and she cut him off. "I'm being
      serious. It upsets the natural order."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he's right and can copy your memories," Roger said with a
      slight quaver in his voice, "it's like you could live
      forever."
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan felt a lump in her throat, and she took a deep breath.
      So that's what this was all about. She suddenly felt like
      crying, but she held it back. Instead she let go of the rock
      with her left hand so she could pivot to look down at Roger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at her, and she could see the fear in his eyes.
      Her bout with ovarian cancer had changed him. The carefree boy
      turned more solemn. Roger tried to pretend to be that same
      man, but his fear of losing her would surface at unexpected
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roger," she said. "Promise me you won't ever do that to me."
    </p>
    <p>Roger opened his mouth but no sound came out.</p>
    <p>"Promise me," she said.</p>
    <p>"If I lost you, I'd—"</p>
    <p>
      "Roger, no." He tried to argue, but she cut him off. "No!" Her
      voice shook, and she turned away so that she would not start
      crying. The pain in his face was too hard to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed her eyes and leaned her head against the cliff
      face. Her helmet made a soft scraping sound on the rock. "It
      wouldn't be me," she said. "It wouldn't have my soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger muttered something she could not hear, but he sounded
      angry. This had been such a good day, and now they were
      ruining it by fighting. Maybe she could still salvage it. She
      let go with her left hand and turned around. "Roger, honey,
      let's not fi—"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her right hand slipped. She had leaned back too far, her
      emotions clouding her judgment. She flailed her left hand at
      the wall, but she had already lost her grip. She tilted into
      the air, a slow motion fall that she was powerless to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was happening too fast for her to think. Her body
      went into autopilot, her arms flapping at the air. Susan's
      body picked up speed as gravity took over, and she felt
      herself tumbling. She thought she heard Roger screaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her free fall lasted only a fraction of a second before her
      left arm slammed into a part of the cliff that jutted out. She
      felt the vibration of her bones breaking, but she did not feel
      any pain. She tried to grab the rock with her right hand, but
      it just scraped across the rocks and peeled the skin off.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bounced away from the cliff, more out than down because of
      her collision with the wall. She had finally gone far enough
      for the rope to catch her, but she was upside down when it
      did. Her momentum slammed her against the cliff and she
      bounced away again. Pain tore through her entire body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan tried to flip upright before she hit the cliff again,
      but her body was not responding. She hit and bounced off. She
      gave up on flipping. She rotated instead so that she was
      looking at the cliff. She reached out as she came closer to
      the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her right hand brushed the rock, but she could not grab onto
      anything. She could not feel her left arm below the shoulder,
      and her right hand was slick with blood. She left streaks of
      blood on the granite.
    </p>
    <p>
      She finally was able to get a hold on a large jug, using her
      wrist to get enough traction to keep her still in one spot. It
      had only been a few seconds since she fell, and now she was
      upside down staring at a drop of several hundred feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her senses started to return, and the first thing she heard
      was Roger yelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm alright," she tried to say, but her voice did not work.
      She took a few ragged breaths and tried again. "I'm alright!"
      she yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How bad are you hurt?" Roger said. "Can you climb back up?"
      He sounded scared, but she was impressed by how well he was
      holding it together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said. She was barely holding herself still, and the
      blood rushing to her head made her eyes feel like they were
      bulging out. "You'll have to climb down here and help me."
    </p>
    <p>"Okay," Roger said. "Hang tight. I'm coming down."</p>
    <p>
      She tried to calm herself by taking deep breaths. Everything
      will be fine. Roger would get her back upright, and then they
      would figure out how to safely get off the mountain. He was a
      good climber. He would get to her soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her harness slipped. The straps should have been able to hold
      her even while upside down, but she could feel the flat nylon
      sliding over her hips. Susan panicked. She let go of her hold
      on the rock and grabbed at the rope clamped to her waist. She
      drifted away from the wall and hung in midair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrapped two of her fingers around the rope, but they
      immediately slipped off. Susan tightened her abs and swung
      upwards, flinging her good arm. Her wrist flew wide and missed
      the rope. She only had time for one more attempt before she
      fell completely out of the harness.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all of her strength, Susan heaved her torso upwards and
      reached with her arm. She was too late. Her legs slipped
      through the loops of the harness, and her arm missed the rope
      by inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spun head over heels as she fell. The bright blue sky and
      ground swirled together, and she felt an overwhelming sadness.
      Roger, Roger, Roger, Roger, Roger, Roger, Roger, Roger, Roger.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>-----</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Susan woke up.</p>
    <p>
      She was lying down in a large bed staring at a plain white
      ceiling. She felt dizzy and could not remember where she was.
      She blinked hard to try to force her brain to work, and she
      ran her hands across the soft sheets under her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked around and saw Roger. He stood a few steps away
      from the bed, clutching his hands together in front of him. He
      looked different, like he had aged a year. Something about the
      way he was standing made her uncomfortable, but she was too
      groggy to put a finger on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger opened his mouth and made a slight motion like he was
      going to come closer, but he stopped himself. He opened his
      mouth to speak. His lips moved for a moment without words, and
      he looked like he was on the verge of tears. "Susan?" he said,
      his voice choking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roger," she said. Her voice felt odd, and she had a strange
      sensation that she had never used it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger burst into tears and fell to his knees beside the bed.
      He embraced her with his muscular arms and buried his face in
      her chest. Susan started crying because he was crying. What
      was wrong? Susan could not remember anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan wrapped her arms around him to hold him. Her arms felt
      weak, and she had trouble controlling them. She wrapped her
      fingers gently around the back of his neck so that her arm
      would stay steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their tears stopped but they stayed in the same place for a
      long time. Neither of them spoke. Susan tried to recall the
      last thing she had been doing before waking up in this bed,
      but her memories were like wet ropes slipping out of her
      grasp. She felt a twinge of fear. Was she sick? Dying?
    </p>
    <p>
      She pushed those thoughts away and looked around the room. It
      was a chic modern apartment decorated in a minimalist style. A
      large flat screen television was mounted on the wall opposite
      the bed beside the mirrored sliding doors of a closet. To her
      left was a pair of mahogany double doors that were closed. The
      wall to her right was clear floor-to-ceiling glass with doors
      leading to a large balcony with an amazing view of the New
      York skyline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The double doors swung open, and Ganesh walked into the room.
      Susan gasped. Ganesh was the last person she would have
      expected to be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you're awake," Ganesh said. He walked to the bedside and
      laid a hand on Roger's back. "Roger, I need to run some
      tests."
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger looked up into Susan's eyes. "Okay," he said, not taking
      his eyes off of her. Ganesh helped Roger to his feet and
      guided him to a seat at the foot of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ganesh took a small flashlight out of a pocket of the lab coat
      he was wearing. "How are you feeling Susan?" he said as he sat
      on the edge of the bed at her side.
    </p>
    <p>"What's happening?" Susan said. She looked to Roger.</p>
    <p>
      "There was an accident," Ganesh said. He flicked on the
      flashlight and shined it into her right eye. He put his thumb
      against her cheek to pull her eyelid down, and she jerked away
      out of reflex. She did not like Ganesh. "Come now," Ganesh
      said, "I need to make sure you're healthy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since when are you a doctor?" Susan said. She struggled to
      sit up in bed. "Roger, tell me what happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I lost you," Roger said. Tears rolled down his cheeks. "I
      couldn't get to you in time. You slipped out of the rope
      and... and..." He broke down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ganesh shook his head and smiled at Roger. "But it's all back
      to how it should be now, Roger," he said. He gestured at Susan
      with a wave of his hand. "Susan is here with us and she is in
      perfect health." He frowned at Susan. "Well, I will assume
      it's perfect health since you will not let me check."
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan felt disoriented and a little scared. What did Roger
      mean about losing her? There had been an accident? She could
      not remember anything. She scrambled to get off of the bed to
      stand up. Her knees wobbled but she kept her footing. The more
      she moved, the more stable she felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked around the bed and put her hands on Roger's
      shoulders. He looked up at her and wrapped his arms around her
      waist. "Please, Roger. Tell me what happened," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You died," Roger said. He shuddered and held her tighter. "We
      were climbing. You fell. Your harness came off. And you fell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand," Susan said. She rubbed her hand across
      her chest. "You mean, like clinically dead? A heart attack?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ganesh stood up and walked around the room, stroking his beard
      absentmindedly. "No Susan," Ganesh said. "He means you
      literally died. You fell from over two hundred feet and landed
      on a boulder. Your body was completely broken and you were
      quite, quite dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan shook her head. "That's absurd," she said. She pointed
      at herself with both hands. "I'm standing here talking to you
      right now. I couldn't have died."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but that's where you're wrong," Ganesh said. He smiled
      more. "I cloned you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan's jaw dropped open and she stared at Ganesh in shock.
      Then she burst out in laughter. "Oh my God," she said. She
      slapped Roger on the head. "This isn't funny."
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger looked at her and his face showed no signs of humor.
      "It's true," he said. "You died and we brought you back to
      life."
    </p>
    <p>"I brought you back to life," Ganesh said.</p>
    <p>
      This was impossible. Susan grabbed Roger's arms and pulled
      them away from her waist. He was reluctant to let go, but she
      shoved him off. She stumbled to the mirror on the wall and
      looked at her reflection. What they were saying was completely
      impossible. It was absurd. But why did she feel like the
      person looking back at her in the mirror was not really her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ganesh stepped up behind Susan and his reflection stared at
      her. "Marvelous, isn't it?" he said. "I've been developing the
      technology for years, and I'm close to going to market. You
      are my first human subject, and you are the proof that I've
      discovered how to cheat death."
    </p>
    <p>
      The realization hit Susan at once. Ganesh was not a man who
      joked. Ever. If he said it was true, then it was. Susan fell
      to her knees on the floor and dry heaved. There was nothing in
      her stomach, and only a thin sliver of bile spilled onto the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ganesh knelt down and placed a hand on her shoulder. "Are you
      alright?" he said. "I must run tests on you to ensure that you
      are functioning properly. I'm particularly anxious to run you
      through some cognitive tests to make sure that your memories
      were transferred intact."
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan batted Ganesh away with a wordless scream. He stumbled
      back onto his ass and slid away from her. He stood up and
      brushed his lab coat to straighten it out. She turned to
      Roger. "How could you?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>Roger looked guilty. "I can't live my life without you."</p>
    <p>
      "Me?" Susan screamed and stood up. "Who am I? I'm not Susan.
      I'm—I'm a ghost walking around wearing a mask that looks like
      her." A wave of dizziness washed over her. She stayed on her
      feet out of sheer anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're Susan," Roger said. He stood up and took deliberate
      steps toward her. "You're my wife. I proposed to you at a
      wobbly table in the same coffee shop where we had our first
      date. You said yes. We're going to grow old together and live
      on the southern coast of France when we retire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger reached out to hug Susan, but she put her hands on his
      chest and shoved him away. "I'm not that person, Roger. That
      person died. The thing—me—that you're talking to doesn't have
      a soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ganesh scoffed. "Please, let's have none of that religion
      garbage," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan turned on Ganesh. "Fuck you," she said. "You think you
      know everything. But you don't know God even though you're
      playing at being Him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ganesh tsked. "This was always your problem, Susan," he said.
      "You believe in fairy tales and ignore the actual real science
      staring you in the face."
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan turned away. Ganesh's attitude toward her and her
      beliefs was the reason she had cut him out of her life. Or, it
      was the reason that the real Susan had cut him out of her
      life. What was she, this person with a dead woman's memories?
      She felt sick again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please keep an open mind," Roger said. He tried to hug her
      again, but her stare made him stop. "Do it for me. I can't go
      on without you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without who?" Susan said. "Without Susan? She's dead." She
      put her hand on his chest and pushed him hard again. She
      walked to the balcony doors to put the bed between her and the
      two men. "This is sick, Roger. How could you do it? You had to
      know that Susan would not have wanted this."
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger looked down at the floor. Susan's jaw dropped. "She told
      you that she didn't want this, didn't she?" Roger would not
      look up to meet her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ganesh held his hands together in front of him, almost like he
      was going to pray. "Please, Susan, let's take a step back from
      this for a moment," he said. "This is all very shocking
      information, and I'm sure we should have done a better job of
      breaking the news to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan was not listening to him. Her mind was reeling with the
      revelation of what she was. Her very being was a sin against
      the natural order. Every moment she existed was an affront to
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      She decided to act before she could change her mind. She
      turned and flung the door open. She could hear the men yelling
      as she bolted across the balcony and leapt over the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan tumbled head over heels as she fell through the air. She
      briefly wondered what had gone through the mind of the real
      Susan before the woman had died. She hit the pavement before
      she could finish the thought.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>-----</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Susan woke up.</p>
    <p>
      She was in a hospital. She stared up at the white ceiling
      tiles from her bed, and she heard a monitor beeping along with
      the beat of her heart. She looked around and saw Roger
      sleeping in an uncomfortable looking chair beside the bed. She
      tried to speak but her voice croaked, almost like she had
      never used it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan cleared her throat and tried again. "Roger," she said.
      Roger jerked awake. His eyes opened wide and he looked at
      Susan. Something about his gaze made Susan feel uncomfortable,
      but she was too groggy to put her finger on it.
    </p>
    <p>"Where am I?" she said.</p>
    <p>
      "You're in a hospital," Roger said. To Susan, he seemed very
      hesitant. "Do you remember anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan tried to think back, but her memory was fuzzy. "I'm not
      sure," she said. "What happened, Roger?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger took a deep breath. "You were in an accident," he said.
      "We were climbing and you fell. You hit your head and—" He
      looked up at the ceiling. "And you've been in a coma for
      almost a year."
    </p>
    <p>
      A year? Susan started to cry. "Oh no," she said. "Am I... Is
      there any permanent damage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," Roger said. His whole body seemed to suddenly relax, and
      he smiled at her. "You had a head injury, so your memory might
      be funny at first. But the doctors say it should all come back
      in time." He reached out and held her hand, careful not to
      disturb the IV needle in her arm.
    </p>
    <p>"You've been here the whole time?" she said.</p>
    <p>Roger looked away. "Every day," he said.</p>
    <p>"Thank you," she said.</p>
    <p>
      Roger looked back at her, and it looked like he was on the
      verge of crying. "I don't know what I would do if I lost you,"
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm still here," she said, smiling. "It's going to take
      a lot more than a fall to kill me." She thought that comment
      would make Roger smile, but instead he looked like he was
      going to be sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan held out her arms, and Roger leaned over to hug her. She
      thought about what it would be like to be in Roger's shoes. A
      spouse stuck in a coma. Wondering every day if they would wake
      up. She knew she should be happy that she had survived and she
      was reunited with him, but Susan could not shake the feeling
      that Roger was lying to her.
