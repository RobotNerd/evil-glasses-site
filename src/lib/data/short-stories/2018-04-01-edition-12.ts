  'Prostitute': `
    <p>
      Clyde watched Andy give the presentation. Clyde thought about
      Andy's ugly downturned mouth, his eyes that bulged whenever
      someone who had a title talked, that his jacket didn't sit
      squarely on his right shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell me no, Andy, tell me no. Be that guy,' Clyde thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clyde leaned forward in his chair, put his forearms on the
      table, and sighed before speaking to halt the conversation. “I
      think,” he started, “that we should shut down half of the
      software department and move those funds over to HR.” He
      paused. “Andy, what do you think?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That should work,” Andy said nodding his head too much. Clyde
      knew that it was without thought that he came to this
      conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>'Andy,' Clyde thought, 'what the fuck?'</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Clyde and his only-actual-friend Rick were at their usual bar.
    </p>
    <p>“I'm giving them a reason to tell me no and they don't.”</p>
    <p>
      Rick reached over and wiggled Clyde's earlobe. Clyde shooed
      his hand away.
    </p>
    <p>“Rick! Fuck, dude.” Clyde smiled through his annoyance.</p>
    <p>
      Rick laughed, and then puckered his lips while he talked. “I
      know who would tell you no and show you a good time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Clyde took a healthy gulp of his whiskey. “Sounds like I
      shouldn't ask.”
    </p>
    <p>“Get a prostitute to step on your balls.”</p>
    <p>Clyde screwed up his face at Rick. “No. What?”</p>
    <p>
      Rick swished his whiskey in his tumbler. “Isn't that what
      being told 'no' is. A kick in the nuts?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Clyde opened his mouth to speak but Rick raised a finger to
      silence him. “But you, Mr. All-Important-Sullivan, have never
      been told no. Must be nice.”
    </p>
    <p>“It isn't.”</p>
    <p>
      Clyde thought about getting hit in the genitals and cringed.
    </p>
    <p>“Have you ever done it?” Clyde asked.</p>
    <p>
      “Don't need to,” Rick took a drink and squirted a small bit of
      it between his teeth and said, “I get my balls broken all
      day.”
    </p>
    <br />
    <p align="center">***</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      “Oh, yes Mr. Sullivan, that's a great idea.” A woman in a
      smart suit said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No it isn't.” Clyde looked at her. “You,” he pointed to a man
      in smart suit, “was that a great idea?”
    </p>
    <p>“Oh yes Mr. Sullivan, that's a great idea,” he said.</p>
    <p>
      Clyde was amazed and looked from person to person. “I want to
      cut pensions and give the top 1% a raise.”
    </p>
    <p>They all nodded their heads and mumbled in agreement.</p>
    <p>“That's fucking stupid!” Clyde yelled.</p>
    <br />
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Clyde and Rick were at the bar again. Clyde was drunk anyone
      would have known. His shirt was un-tucked, his hair fluffy,
      his mouth hung open when he wasn't talking, his body hung
      heavy from the barstool.
    </p>
    <p>“It would hurt, man. No,” Clyde said.</p>
    <p>
      Rick pointed at Clyde. “You're God damned right it would.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Clyde raised his lip, “Couldn't she just tell me no and then,
      like, pinch my arm or something?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Rick put his finger in Clyde's ear and moved it in a circle.
      Clyde pulled away almost falling off his stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That kind of 'no' would be meaningless. You need real pain.
      Right in your scrotum.” He winked.
    </p>
    <p>“Uh,” Clyde was disgusted.</p>
    <p>
      He thought of this woman punishing his privates. She had a
      featureless face except her mouth making the sweet shape of
      the word no. Her beautiful mouth and that wonderful word made
      him smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clyde cleared his throat and looked toward Rick but not at
      him. “So, how would I,” he cleared his throat, “someone go
      about,” he paused, “finding a woman who will, um, step on my
      balls?”
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Clyde paced his floor and wiped the sweat from his hands on
      his pants.
    </p>
    <p>
      His phone rang with the caller ID of doorbell. He took a deep
      breath and marched to the door.
    </p>
    <p>There she was, the woman who would tell him no.</p>
    <p>
      She pushed past him and stood in the middle of the room with
      her back to him. She wore a khaki colored trench coat, bare
      legs to her black lace up combat boots, not military grade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clyde shut the door and turned but didn't step any closer to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>“Come here,” she said over her shoulder.</p>
    <p>
      He took a few steps inside. “Do you want to sit or have a
      drink?”
    </p>
    <p>“No.”</p>
    <p>
      He furrowed his brow and lifted his lip at her quick response.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Okay.” He stepped closer to her. “Want me to take your
      jacket?”
    </p>
    <p>“No.”</p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes and his face scrunched up like he smelled
      hot, wet garbage.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fine.” He walked around her in a wide berth until stopping in
      front of her. “Are you going to do any of that, 'get on all
      fours like a dog'?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked in her eyes. They were grey-blue and deeply
      beautiful. Her lips were full and painted a ruby red. Her
      cheekbones were high and accented by her short dark brown bob
      hairstyle. Her face was sultry and sensual and he was smitten.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.” She gently shook her head. Her face was blank. Then her
      lips turned down, her forehead wrinkled up. Her eyes went wide
      as she turned into a different person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clyde watched this horrific transformation as if he was a
      statue unable to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent down a bit, twisted her shoulders to the right,
      stepped her right foot back, and with the full force of her
      body drop kicked Clyde directly in the balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the air in Clyde's body disappeared in a noise he had
      never made before. He crumbled to the floor gasping for breath
      and coughing. He grabbed his package and wiggled on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood over him and patiently waited until he was still and
      had his breathing under control.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her from the corner of his eyes afraid to move.
      “Alright, you got me good, you can go now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped one knee in front of him, leaned down to look him
      in the face, and smiled with those beautiful eyes and full
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>“No.”</p>
    <p>She balled up her fist and punched him in the dick.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Clyde spun a pen around the fingers of his right hand. Andy
      was back asking for more software engineers because progress
      was basically halted after Clyde's earlier suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know, Andy, why don't you go down there and get them back
      into shape? You know how to do that right?” Clyde asked with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andy nodded. “Yes. I'm the senior office manager but yes. I'll
      learn how to program.”
    </p>
    <p>Clyde nodded. “I like you, Andy.”</p>`,






  'A Hot Week in August': `
    <p>
      Mason dropped the shovel onto the dry, rocky ground. He leaned
      back against the truck beside Earl. "You don't want to travel
      through Europe?" Mason said. "Everybody wants to do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ain't got no interest in traveling nowhere," Earl said. He
      pushed back his dirty baseball cap and swiped his hand across
      his forehead. He flicked the sweat off of his fingers. Some of
      it splashed onto Mason's boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mason frowned at the small wet spot on his boot. He used the
      heel of his other foot to try to scrape it off. "I'm just
      saying, you ought to get out and see the world. There's more
      to life than Greenville."
    </p>
    <p>
      Earl didn't look at Mason. Instead he stared straight ahead,
      out over the tall brown grass in the field. It hadn't rained
      in a month, and the land was suffering for it. One spark, and
      the whole state would go up. Everybody was worried about it,
      but there wasn't a whole lot they could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's nothing out there I need to see. I'll leave the
      exploring to young folks like you," Earl said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mason shook his head. "You aren't that old yet. What are you,
      like thirty-seven?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thirty-<i>three</i>." Earl said. He turned halfway around and
      reached into the bed of the truck. He popped open the lid of
      the cooler and pulled out a soda. "Want one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nah, I'm good right now," Mason said. Earl closed the cooler.
      He leaned back against the side of the truck and opened the
      can. Mason kicked in the dirt with the toe of his boot, making
      a small divot in the ground. A bit of dust puffed up into the
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The firebreak stretched off into the distance to their left.
      This was their fifth day on the job. Backbreaking work from
      sun up to sundown, using shovels and pickaxes to cut a wide
      dirt channel along the edge of the field. Old man Comstock
      didn't want to use a tractor out there—he said the noise would
      scare his prize-winning roosters. He was a crazy old coot, but
      Mason was glad to have the work, even if it was just part
      time. Jobs were hard to come by these days.
    </p>
    <p>"How do you know?" Mason said.</p>
    <p>
      "Huh?" Earl said, looking Mason in the eyes for the first time
      in the last hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know there's nothing that would be interesting to
      you in Europe?" Mason said.
    </p>
    <p>Earl pursed his lips. "I don't want to talk about it."</p>
    <p>
      "You don't want to talk about it because you don't have a good
      reason. You're just making excuses," Mason said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever," Earl said. He reached in the truck and grabbed a
      shovel. He jammed the tip of the shovel in the dirt at his
      feet, then pulled on his leather work gloves. "Break's over."
    </p>
    <p>
      They spent the rest of the afternoon in silence, cutting a
      channel in the bone dry earth at a snail's pace.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      A grasshopper hiding somewhere in the tall grass made its
      mating call. The high-pitched screeching sound echoed across
      the dry field. The air was heavy today, without even the
      slightest breeze to help alleviate the heat. Mason and Earl
      were only twenty yards further along from where they were
      yesterday. Mason figured it was good progress, all things
      considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been thinking," Mason said. The two men were sitting on
      the open tailgate, eating their lunches. Mason had a peanut
      butter and jelly sandwich on wheat bread. Earl was eating
      beans out of a can.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do too much of that," Earl said around a mouthful of
      beans. "You're going to hurt your head."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mason ignored him. "I figure the reason you don't want to get
      out of Greenville is because you've never left this town. You
      don't know what you're missing because you don't know what
      you're missing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Earl dipped his spoon down in the beans and stirred them
      around. "That's about the dumbest thing I've ever heard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe," Mason said. He took another bite out of his sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earl scooped a spoonful of beans into his mouth. "Not
      everybody's got to think like you do. Different people see
      different things as being important."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mason finished his lunch. He tossed the empty sandwich bag in
      his lunch box and opened another bottle of water. Earl scraped
      the last of the beans into his mouth. He tossed the empty can
      over his shoulder into the truck bed.
    </p>
    <p>"What's important to you?" Mason said.</p>
    <p>
      Earl grabbed his shovel off the ground. "Right now, it's
      finishing another twenty yards before sundown."
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      By the late afternoon of the following day, they had reached
      the southern corner of the field, where it butted up against
      the forest. Towering columns of clouds had been forming in the
      distance for the past few hours, promising the relief of rain
      but carrying the threat of fire-starting lightning strikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mason stood up tall and stretched his back. A faint rumble of
      thunder echoed from a distant cloud. "Maybe we should call it
      a day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Earl kept cutting a groove in the rocky soil with his pickaxe.
      "It ain't that close. We can keep going."
    </p>
    <p>
      A drop of sweat ran down Mason's neck to his already soaked
      shirt. He was covered in grime that had mixed with the sweat
      to form a paste coating his skin. He took a long shower every
      night to scrub himself clean, but it felt like there was more
      grime every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The edge of one of the clouds moved past the sun, providing
      welcome relief from the intense heat. "I'd rather not be out
      here when a storm comes—"
    </p>
    <p><i>BOOM!</i></p>
    <p>
      The shock wave slammed into Mason so hard his bones vibrated.
      All he could see was white, brighter than the sun, searing his
      eyes. It was over in a split second, and he could see again.
      The sound of thunder reverberated off the distant hills, and
      his ears rang. Splinters of wood began falling out of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earl was on his back in the dirt. His eyes were wild. "What
      the hell was that?" he yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lightning!" Mason said. He pointed at a nearby tree. The
      trunk was split in two, almost down to the ground. Earl
      scrambled to his feet and ran to the truck. Mason crawled in
      the cab after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within seconds, the sky opened up and rain hammered down on
      the truck. It was like someone poured a bucket of water on
      them, the rain was so thick they couldn't see out of the front
      windshield. They sat there in silence, watching the rain, both
      trying to calm down after the close call with the lightning
      strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while the rain lessened, though it didn't stop. Mason
      wondered if Comstock would tell them to stop work on the
      firebreak now. He hoped not. As much as he didn't like doing
      backbreaking work, he really needed the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My old man died when he was fifty-three," Earl said. He
      looked out at the field, the tall brown grass now bent over
      from the power of the storm. "He worked in the warehouse his
      whole miserable life, and then he just died. He never got to
      enjoy living."
    </p>
    <p>
      Earl leaned back and looked up at the roof of the cab, his
      head resting against the back windshield. "But at least he had
      a steady job, enough to support my mama and me. All those jobs
      are gone now. I'm as miserable as my dad ever was, except I
      don't have nothing. I'm never going to have money to buy a
      house and have a family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care about nothing outside of Greenville because I
      can't barely survive here," Earl said. "And you're in the same
      boat as me. Out here working a job that don't pay shit because
      there ain't nothing else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Earl turned and looked Mason in the eye. "What's important to
      <i>you</i>, Mason?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mason started to speak but realized he didn't have an answer.
      Earl stared at him for a long time. Mason looked away. "That's
      what I thought," Earl said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain slowed to a drizzle. The men sat in the truck, not
      speaking, watching the rain. The entire length of the
      firebreak was a muddy trench. Mason wondered if it would still
      stop a wildfire. Would there even be a danger of that now?
      Probably not for a while.
