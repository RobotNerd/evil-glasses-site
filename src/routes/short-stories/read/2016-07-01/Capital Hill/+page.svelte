	<h3>Play of Dialogue About Accepting Change in an Extraordinary Place</h3>

	<p class="mb-4">Thanks.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Anything good happen yet?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">I feel like the sky is greener than usual.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Might be that EXT382-B finally set. Move your chair a little, my knees feel cramped.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Yes, sorry.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">See those people over there?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">No.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Over there. Right there.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Yes, yes, I see them now.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Do you know them?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		No, I don't. So many more people show up here now. Most of them don't stick around to talk.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">We should scare them away.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Don't think like that. Let them be.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">We used to know everyone that showed up.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">And today it's fine that it's just them and us.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">That's fucked.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">But that's the way things go.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">They probably don't even know—</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Oh, look over there, look!</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Shit, shit, where are you pointing?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Right over there, follow my arm. You see where the cloud is pushing?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">There it is. I see it.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">They're seeing it too. Good for them for noticing.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">It's not good and they need to calm the fuck down.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">You can't deny that it is exciting. You shouldn't fault them for that.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">I hope it's a flat day, that way they don't come back.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Well, I hope it isn't! I was really hoping to see one today.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Fine, I hope one comes out once they leave.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">I guess that's fine.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Shh! Did you hear that?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">No, I don't hear—</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Shh.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">I think it's just the wind.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Shhh!</p>
	<p class="mb-4">It's them talking.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Ah, you're right. Shit.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">I think they're on a date.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Jesus, a date?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		It is serene and romantic up here. There's going to be a lot more people showing up.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Fuck that.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">If we were able to come upon this place others were bound to, as well.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Okay, I get it. It just sucks.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Luxury condos will go right where we're sitting.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Are you fucking serious? That's fucked. When?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">I'm just joking.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">That's a horrible joke.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Look, it's happening again.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">It's bigger this time. It probably will happen with them here.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Oh, let it go. My feet are tingling.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Why?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">It's exciting.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">I know. It's just the way you say it.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Most everyone would want to see one. You can't blame people for that.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Blame isn't the right word. I just don't want them here.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">You mean you don't want this to change?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">I don't want other people here.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Isn't that the same thing?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">This isn't like a restaurant where if people don't show up it closes.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">So what do you think will happen?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">That we'll never see one again. Okay? Jesus.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Oh, well, that is a scary thought. But do you actually think that?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		I don't know, maybe. I just don't want to get to the point where it might happen.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Ah! That was loud!</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Damn, that made you jump.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">There, there! A fin!</p>
	<p class="mb-4">It's purple? Am I seeing that right?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Yes, it looks like it is.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Shit. Have we ever seen a purple fin?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">No. I would have remembered something like this.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">It's coming through.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Oh my God, she's pink. She's amazing.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">She's huge, way bigger than normal. Here she comes.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Her whole body is pink. We've never seen a pink whale. She's the size of the sky.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">No, not that big. She's coming right towards us.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">She can't see us though.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">I read that they could. They're scared over there.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">You should watch her instead of them.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">She's turning back.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Wow. She was great. Our first and maybe our only one.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">They're packing up.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Stop worrying about them.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">I can't believe they saw a rare whale their first time out.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">It might not be their first time.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		First time here then. It's taken us this long to see one and they see it their first time.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Does being upset about it change anything?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">What are you talking about?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Will people stop coming if you stay angry about it?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">I hope so.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		The real answer is no. So why stay angry? You can simply enjoy what we saw today and hope that
		we see one again tomorrow.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Look, they waved.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">See, they even acknowledged us.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Yeah.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Do you have to go?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">No. Do you?</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Nope. Maybe she'll come back.</p>
