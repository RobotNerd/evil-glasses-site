                  Stop inflation in its tracks in this fast-paced arcade
                  shooter.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Inflation is out of control! After years of quantitative
                  easing, the Federal Reserve must reverse course. Who would
                  have guessed that pumping free money into the economy would
                  have negative consequences?
                </p>

                <p>
                  But how do we fight inflation? Address rampant wealth
                  inequality? Fix the exploding costs of healthcare? Build more
                  housing to drive down prices? Bother to address any of the
                  underlying problems with the economy? Nope. Let's raise
                  interest rates!
                </p>

                <p>
                  You are the head of the Federal Reserve, and you have one tool
                  in your central planning toolbox for manipulating the economy:
                  interest rate hikes. This raises the costs of loans between
                  banks, which raises the cost for businesses to borrow money.
                  Those increased costs will lead to layoffs. We can't have any
                  reduction in profits, now can we?
                </p>

                <p>
                  You will know your plan is working by how many jobs you
                  destroy. If people lose their jobs, they won't have money to
                  spend. And if they can't spend money, prices go down and so
                  does inflation. Simple logic.
                </p>
